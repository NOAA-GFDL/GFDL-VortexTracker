c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine is the core of the program.  It contains
c     the main loop for looping through all the forecast hours and all
c     the storms.  Basically, the way it works is that it has an outer 
c     loop that loops on the forecast hour.  At the beginning of this 
c     loop, the data are read in for all parameters and levels needed
c     for tracking.  The full regional or global grid is read in. 
c     If vorticity was not read in (some of the centers do not send us
c     vorticity), then vorticity calculations are done on the whole 
c     grid at both 850 and 700 mb.  Then the program goes into the inner
c     loop, which loops on storm number (program originally set up to 
c     handle a max of 15 storms).  For each storm, subroutine 
c     find_maxmin is called for the following parameters: Rel Vort and  
c     geopotential hgt at 700 & 850 mb, and MSLP.  Within find_maxmin,
c     a barnes analysis is performed over the guess position of the 
c     storm to find the max or min value, and then iteratively, the 
c     grid size is cut in half several times and the  barnes analysis
c     rerun to refine the positioning of the max or min location.  After
c     the center positions for these parameters have been obtained, 
c     subroutine  get_uv_center is called to get a center fix for the 
c     minimum in the wind field, specifically, a minimum in the
c     magnitude of the wind speed (vmag).  The calculation of the vmag
c     minimum is done differently than the calculation for the other
c     parameters;  for vmag, the grid near the storm center guess 
c     position is interpolated down to a very fine grid, and then 
c     find_maxmin is called and a barnes analysis is done on that 
c     smaller grid.  For vmag, there are no further calls made to barnes
c     with a smaller grid, since the grid has already been interpolated 
c     down to a smaller grid.  Once all of the parameter center fixes 
c     have been made, subroutine  fixcenter is called to average these 
c     positions together to get a best guess fix position.  Then a check
c     is done with a call to subroutine  is_it_a_storm to make sure that
c     the center that we have found does indeed resemble a tropical 
c     cyclone.  Finally, subroutine  get_next_ges is called to make a 
c     guess position for the next forecast time for this storm.

c     maxstorm   maximum # of storms to be handled
c     numtcv     number of storms read off of the tcvitals file
c     ifhmax     max number of analysis & forecast times to be handled
c     trkrinfo   derived type that holds/describes various tracker parms

c                file from the  open_ncfile subroutine.
c     nc_lsmask_file   if the input data type is netcdf, and if there is
c                a separate file for the land-sea mask, then this
c                nc_lsmask_file variable contains the name of that
c                netcdf land-sea mask file.
c     nc_lsmask_file_id  if the input data type is netcdf, and if there
c                is a separate file for the land-sea mask, then this

c                8: 700 mb gp hgt
c                9: MSLP
c                10: near-surface u-comp
c                11: near-surface v-comp
c                12: 500 mb u-comp
c                13: 500 mb v-comp

c                16: 200 mb gp hgt

c                18: 200 mb u-comp

c
c     calcparm   L  indicates which parms to track and which not to.
c                Array positions are defined exactly as for clon
c                and clat, listed next, except that, in general, when
c                flag 3 is set to a value, flag 4 is set to the same 
c                value as 3, and when flag 5 is set to a value, flag
c                6 is set to the same value as 5.  This is because 
c                3 & 4 are for the 850 mb winds, and if either u or
c                v is missing, we obviously can't calculate the 
c                magnitude of the wind.  The same applies for 5 & 6,
c                which are for the 700 mb winds. And also for reference,
c                here is a list of all the variables & levels for the 
c                tracked parameters (i.e., the "calcparm" elements):
c

c                all storms at all times for all parameters.
c                (max_#_storms, max_fcst_times, max_#_parms).
c                For the third position (max_#_parms), here they are:
c                 1: Relative vorticity at 850 mb
c                 2: Relative vorticity at 700 mb
c                 3: Wind circulation at 850 mb
c                 4: NOT CURRENTLY USED
c                 5: Wind circulation at 700 mb
c                 6: NOT CURRENTLY USED
c                 7: Geopotential height at 850 mb

c                 9: Mean Sea Level Pressure
c                10: Wind circulation at 10 m

c     xmaxwind   Contains maximum near-surface wind near the storm
c                center for each storm at each forecast hour.
c     stderr     Standard deviation of the position "errors" of the 
c                different parameters for each storm at each time.
c     fixlat,fixlon: Contain the final coordinates for each storm at
c                each forecast hour.  These coordinates are a 
c                weighted average of all the individual parameter
c                positions (hgt, zeta, mslp, vmag).
c     cvort_maxmin: Contains the characters 'max' or 'min', and is 
c                used when calling the  find_maxmin routine for the
c                relative vorticity (Look for max in NH, min in SH).
c     vradius    Contains the distance from the storm fix position to
c                each of the various near-surface wind threshhold 
c                distances in each quadrant. 
c                (3,4) ==> (# of threshholds, # of quadrants)
c                See subroutine  getradii for further details.
c     wfract_cov Fractional coverage (areal coverage) of winds
c                exceeding a certain threshold (34, 50, 64 kts) in
c                each quadrant.
c                (5,5,3) ==> (# of quadrants + 1, # of distance bins,
c                             # of thresholds).
c                The "extra" array size for quadrants (5, instead of 4)
c                is there to hold the total (i.e., "whole disc")
c                statistics.
c                See subroutine  get_fract_wind_cov for further details
c
c     er_wind    Quadrant winds in earth-relative framework
c     sr_wind    Quadrant winds in storm-relative framework
c     er_vr      Quadrant radial winds in earth-relative framework
c     sr_vr      Quadrant radial winds in storm-relative framework
c     er_vt      Quadrant tangential winds in earth-relative framework
c     sr_vt      Quadrant tangential winds in storm-relative framework
c
c     isastorm   Character array used in the call to is_it_a_storm,
c                tells whether the minimum requirement for an MSLP
c                gradient was met (isastorm(1)), whether for the midlat
c                and tcgen cases if a closed mslp contour was found
c                (isastorm(2)), and if a circulation exists at 850 mb
c                (isastorm(3)).  Can have a value of 'Y' (requirement
c                met), 'N' (requirement not met) or 'U' (requirement
c                undetermined, due to the fact that no center location
c                was found for this parameter).
c     maxmini    These 2 arrays contain the i and j indeces for the
c     maxminj    max/min centers that are found using the rough check
c                in first_ges_ctr and subsequent routines.  Only needed
c                for a midlatitude or a genesis run, NOT needed for a
c                TC tracker run.
c     stormct    Integer: keeps and increments a running tab of the
c                number of storms that have been tracked at any time
c                across all forecast hours.  Used only for midlat or
c                tcgen runs.
c     gridprs    This contains the actual value of the minimum pressure
c                at a gridpoint.  The  barnes analysis will return an
c                area-averaged value of pressure; this variable will
c                contain the actual minimum value at a gridpoint near
c                the lat/lon found by the  barnes analysis.
c     closed_mslp_ctr_flag  This flag keeps track of the value of the 
c                closed contour flag returned from subroutine
c                check_closed_contour.
c     closed_mslp_ctr_flag2  This flag also keeps track of the value of
c                the closed contour flag returned from subroutine
c                check_closed_contour.  But it does it for a different
c                use.  Yes, it's a little redundant, but this was the
c                least disruptive alternative.
c     vt850_flag This flag keeps track of the value of the flag for 
c                the 850 mb Vt check.
c     shear      real array containing both the magnitude and direction
c                of the storm-centered 850-200 mb vertical shear.  In
c                the 3rd element of the array, index 1 is for shear
c                magnitude and index 2 is for shear direction.
c     already_computed_domain_wide_rh character (y/n) indicates if RH
c             has already been computed across the whole domain for this
c             forecast hour (this keeps us from re-computing it for 
c             every storm at each lead time).

c             Just because we've found a center doesn't mean there is
c             actually a storm there.  I noticed in the first year that
c             for some decaying or just weak storms, the  tracker would
c             identify a center to follow, but it may have only been
c             a weak trough passing by, or something else that's not
c             our storm.  This next subroutine checks to see that the 
c             surface pressure gradient and/or tangential winds at 
c             850 mb resemble a storm.  It is called twice; the first
c             time for MSLP, the 2nd time for 850 mb winds.  We will
c             apply these storm-checking criteria if either the mslp
c             or v850 check come back negative.  Remember, there
c             is the possibility that centers could not be found for 
c             1 or both of these parameters, in which case the isastorm
c             flag will have a value of 'U', for "undetermined".

C     ABSTRACT: This subroutine must be called before any attempt is
C     made to read from the input GRIB files.  The GRIB and index files
C     are  opened with a call to baopenr.  This call to baopenr was not
C     needed in the cray version of this program (the files could be
C     opened with a simple Cray assign statement), but the GRIB-reading
C     utilities on the SP do require calls to this subroutine (it has
C     something to do with the GRIB I/O being done in C on the SP, and
C     the C I/O package needs an explicit open statement).
C
C     INPUT:
c     inp      Contains user-input info on the date & data
C     lugb     The Fortran unit number for the GRIB data file
C     lugi     The Fortran unit number for the GRIB index file
c     ifh      integer index for lead time level
c     gfilename If using individual files for each tau, gfilename will
c              contain the grib data filename for this tau.  Otherwise,
c              if using one big file for all taus, this contains dummy
c              character data. 
c     ifilename If using individual files for each tau, gfilename will 
c              contain the grib index filename for this tau.  Otherwise,
c              if using one big file for all taus, this contains dummy 
c              character data.
C     lout     The Fortran unit number for the  output grib file
c     opening_mask character flag that tells whether or not this call
c              to open_grib_files is for opening land-sea mask data.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine is called after the center of the storm
c     has been fixed.  Its purpose is to determine whether or not 
c     the center that was found is actually a storm, and not just some
c     passing trough (this has happened in the case of decaying or weak
c     storms).  It's called twice -- once to check for a minimum MSLP
c     gradient, and once to check for a circulation at 850 mb.  The 
c     subroutine input parameter "cparm" determines which parameter to
c     check for.
c
c     INPUT:
c     imax     Num pts in i direction on input grid
c     jmax     Num pts in j direction on input grid
c     dx       Grid spacing in i-direction on input grid
c     dy       Grid spacing in j-direction on input grid
c     cparm    Char string indicating what parm is to be checked:
c              slp  = mslp, for a check of mslp gradient
c              v850 = tangential winds at 850 mb
c     ist      integer storm number (internal to the  tracker)
c     defined_pt Logical; bitmap indicating if valid data at that pt.
c     parmlon  Longitude of the max/min value for the input parameter
c     parmlat  Latitude  of the max/min value for the input parameter
c     parmval  Data value at parm's max/min point (used for mslp call)
c     trkrinfo derived type containing grid info on user boundaries
c     ifh      Integer index for the forecast hour
c
c     OUTPUT:
c     stormcheck Character; set to 'Y' if mslp gradient or 850 mb 
c                tangential winds check okay.
c     isiret   Return code for this subroutine.

c     If the input cparm is slp, then check to see that the MSLP 
c     gradient in any direction from the MSLP center is at least 
c     1mb / 200km, or 0.005mb/km.  This is based on discussions with 
c     Morris & Bob, who have had good results using a 2mb/200km 
c     requirement.  Since their model has a much finer resolution than
c     all of the models we run the  tracker on AND a much better 
c     depiction of the hurricane vortex, we do not use a requirement
c     as strict as theirs, and so make the requirement only half as
c     strong as theirs.
c
c     If the input cparm is v850, then check to see that there is
c     a circulation at 850 mb.  We will do this by calculating the
c     tangential wind of all points within a specified radius of 
c     the 850 minimum wind center, and seeing if there is a net
c     average tangential wind speed of at least 5 m/s.
c
c     UPDATE APRIL 2000: I've relaxed the thresholds slightly from
c     0.005 mb/km to 0.003 mb/km, and the wind threshold from 
c     5 m/s to 3 m/s.  Also, note that a special case for GDAS has
c     been hardwired in that is weaker (0.002 mb/km and 2 m/s).
c     That weaker GDAS requirement is for Qingfu's relocation stuff.
c
c     UPDATE JULY 2001: The relaxed requirement put in place in
c     April 2000 for the GDAS relocation has also been put in place
c     for the GFS ensemble relocation.

      ! We will want to speed things up for finer resolution grids.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine  probes around a storm for either the 
c     boundaries of the grid within a distance threshold of a storm
c     center (indicated by input parms pfixlon and pfixlat) or for the
c     existence of missing data, via the valid_pt array, in order to
c     know if a model storm is close to the edge of a fixed regional
c     grid.  If we find even one grid point in our search at an outer
c     radius (which we will initially set to 400 km) that is either 
c     beyond the last imax / jmax or is within the grid imax / jmax
c     boundaries but has missing data (this would be the case for some
c     of the regional grids that have been re-mapped onto a lat/lon 
c     grid, such as the HAFS or T-SHiELD grids), then we set the flag
c     to indicate that we are close to the edge of the grid and return
c     to the calling routine.  If the flag is set to indicate that the
c     storm is close to the edge of valid data, then that calling
c     routine will call other subroutines to apply more rigorous quality
c     control checking, such as checking for a closed MSLP contour.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine is part of the algorithm for determining
c     the structure, or phase, of a cyclone.  For Hart's cyclone phase
c     space, this subroutine determines "Parameter B", which determines
c     the degree of thermal symmetry between the "left" and "right" 
c     hemispheres of a storm, in the layer between 900 and 600 mb.
c     We evaluate only those points that are within 500 km of the 
c     storm center.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine is part of the algorithm for determining
c     the structure, or phase, of a cyclone.  For Hart's cyclone phase
c     space, this subroutine determines the thermal wind profile for 
c     either the lower troposphere (i.e., between 600 and 900 mb) or the
c     upper troposphere (i.e., between 300 and 600 mb).  We evaluate 
c     only those points that are within 500 km of the storm center.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine is part of the algorithm for determining
c     the structure, or phase, of a cyclone.  Here, we are only looking
c     at the mid-to-upper tropospheric warm anomaly at the center of
c     the storm.  The temperature data that we are searching through in
c     the tmean array should be the 300-500 mb mean temperature data.
c     The criteria in this algorithm are based loosely on Vitart's
c     criteria for warm core checking, but the nuts & bolts of the
c     subroutine use algorithms from this tracker, including the  barnes
c     analysis.  First, we locate the warm core with the  find_maxmin
c     routine.  Then we use the  check_closed_contour routine to see if
c     there is a closed temperature contour surrounding the warm core.

c     dx       Grid spacing in i-direction on input grid

c     The Vitart scheme specifies that the temperature must decrease
c     by at least 1.0C in all directions from the warm core center
c     within a distance of 8 deg.  A rigorous check of this criterion
c     is performed here by utilizing the  check_closed_contour routine.
c     If we have a closed contour in the temperature field
c     surrounding the warm core (using a 1 deg K interval), that
c     criterion is satisfied.  For diagnostic purposes, we set the
c     value of num_check_conts to 999 in order to keep searching for
c     all contours surrounding the warm core, and this allows us to
c     get an idea of the "depth" or magnitude of the warm core when
c     the tlastcont and rlastcont values are returned.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine computes a modified lat/lon fix position
c     to use as the input center position for the subroutines that
c     follow which calculate surface-wind related values.  The reason
c     for this is that since we are concerned with the positioning of
c     low-level wind features (e.g., rmax), we want the center position
c     to be based solely on low-level features. We'll use mslp and the
c     min in the sfc wind speed.  If a center fix was unable to be made
c     at this forecast hour for mslp and low-level winds, then we will
c     stick with just using the mean position we got using all the other
c     parameters.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine is a driver subroutine for
c     determining the structure of the low level winds of a cyclone.
c     The algorithm will search out at specified distances from the
c     storm center along arcs in each quadrant of the storm, 
c     evaluating the winds every 15 degrees along the arc.  In each
c     arc, start 7.5 degrees in, then make stops at 22.5, 37.5, 
c     52.5, 67.5, and 82.5 degrees.  At each of those points, we 
c     will bilinearly interpolate the winds to the points along those 
c     arcs.  Then we compute a quadrant average of the wind magnitude,
c     as well as the mean Vt and Vr values.  This will be done
c     twice -- First, for an earth-relative coordinate system, and
c     second, for a storm-relative coordinate system.  For the
c     earth-relative estimates, we will always have 4 earth-relative
c     quadrants: NE, SE, SW and NW.  For the storm-relative estimates,
c     these mean values of the wind will be computed for the same 
c     relative quadrants (front-right, back-right, back-left, front-
c     left, but with respect (positive clockwise) to the
c     direction of storm motion.

c     When evaluating the winds at a gridpoint, keep in mind that each
c     gridpoint represents area around it.  There are 2 special cases
c     we need to watch out for.  The first is for cases in which the
c     area of a gridpoint straddles across a distance threshold, so
c     that some of the gridpoint's area is in the "<200" bin, while
c     some is in the "<100" bin.  The other is for the case in which
c     the area of a gridpoint straddles between 2 adjacent quadrants
c     (e.g., a gridpoint exactly to the north of the center would have
c     half its area in the NW quadrant and half in the NE quadrant).
c
c     To properly "partition" and assign gridpoint areas, we need to
c     interpolate the current grid down to a fine resolution.
c
c     This next if statement determines how many times to interpolate
c     the input grid to a smaller grid.  Here are the guidelines that
c     will be used, keeping in mind that we want the final grid spacing
c     to be on the order of between 0.05 and 0.10 degree (finer than
c     0.05 deg is superfluous, and coarser than 0.10 deg is too coarse).

c     Now loop through the points in this subdomain, determine if any
c     are within 500 km of the center, and then determine what quadrant
c     the point is in relative to the center, and then calculate the
c     fractional area coverage for winds.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine computes the Integrated Kinetic Energy
c     (IKE) and Storm Surge Damage Potential (SDP) values, based on
c     Powell (BAMS, 2007).  At this time, we are only computing the IKE
c     values for TS threshold (17.5 m/s) and above.  We are not yet
c     computing wind damage potential (WDP) since, per Mark Powell
c     (4/2008), he is currently re-formulating an algorithm for it.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine computes the 850-200 mb vertical wind
c     shear.  It uses the method as used in SHIPS, including the vortex
c     removal.  Note that the vortex removal is *not* performed using 
c     the application of the Laplacian filter, as in the 1999 or 
c     2005 DeMaria & Kaplan SHIPS papers.  Instead, via personal 
c     communication (2021) with Mark DeMaria, they said that they didn't
c     have great results with the Laplacian and they instead use this
c     method to remove the vortex:
c
c     1. Find the circulation center at 850 hPa. For SHIPS, that finds
c        the center point that maximizes the symmetric tangential wind
c        out to 500 km. [For the  tracker, I will either use the 
c        mean fix for the current lead time or I will use the fix 
c        position for 850 mb wind circulation].
c
c     2. Calculate the azimuthally averaged radial and tangential wind
c        at each pressure level as a function of radius. At each level,
c        find the radius where the symmetric tangential wind decreases
c        to 1 m/s (r_outer). That radius nearly always decreases with
c        height. Subtract the azimuthally averaged tangential and radial
c        winds out to r = r_outer at each level to remove the vortex. 
c
c     3. Average the Cartesian horizontal wind components after the
c        vortex removal over an area out to 500 km radius at 850 and 
c        200 hPa to get the storm environmental wind vectors at those
c        two levels. 
c
c     4. Use the environmental winds to calculate the shear magnitude
c        and direction. 
c
c     This subroutine basically follows Steps 1-4 above.
c
c     INPUT:
c     imax     num points is i-direction of input grid
c     jmax     num points is j-direction of input grid

c     fixlon   real array with longitudes of mean fix positions
c     fixlat   real array with latitudes of mean fix positions
c     valid_pt Logical bitmap masking non-valid grid points.  This is a
c              concern for the regional models, which are interpolated 
c              from Lam-Conf or NPS grids onto lat/lon grids, leaving 
c              grid points around the edges which have no valid data.
c     calcparm Logical; tells whether or not a parm has a valid fix
c                   at this forecast hour
c     maxstorm max num of storms that can be handled in this run
c     trkrinfo derived type detailing user-specified grid info
c     clon     real array containing the longitudes of all of the 
c              various parameter center fixes that have been found for
c              all lead times.
c     clat     real array containing the latitudes of all of the 
c              various parameter center fixes that have been found for
c              all lead times.
c     gm_wrap_flag character flag set in getgridinfo that determines
c              if GM-wrapping has been set for this grid.
c
c     OUTPUT:
c     shear    real array containing both the magnitude and direction
c              of the storm-centered 850-200 mb vertical shear.  In the
c              3rd element of the array, index 1 is for shear magnitude
c              and index 2 is for shear direction.

c     First, get the fix position to use for calculating the shear.  For
c     now, the same position will be used for both 850 and 200 mb (we 
c     may consider at some point using a separate center fix for 200 mb
c     to account for vortex tilt).  But for now, we will first look to 
c     use the center for the 850 mb wind circulation fix, but if that 
c     fix could not be made for this current lead time, then we will use
c     the mean fix position for this lead time.

     &                    ,gm_wrap_flag)
c
c     ABSTRACT: Given an origin at latitude, longitude=xlato,xlono,
c     this subroutine will locate a target point at a distance dist in
c     km or nautical miles (depends on what you use for "rad_earth..."
c     below), at bearing bear (degrees clockwise from north).
c     Returns latitude xlatt and longitude xlont of target point.
c
c     *** NOTE ***
c     This subroutine was written to handle input lats & lons as this:
c     All latitudes are in degrees, north positive and south negative.
c     All longitudes are in degrees, west positive and east negative.
c     *** **** ***
c
c     However, for the longitudes, the rest of the  tracker uses all
c     0-360 longitudes.  Therefore, we need to convert the input lons
c     and then once again convert the lons that are returned back to
c     the calling routine.
c
c     NOTE-- When origin is at north or south pole, bearing is no
c     longer measured from north.  Instead, bearing is measured
c     clockwise from the longitude opposite that specified in xlono.
c     Example-- if xlato=90., xlono=80., the opposite longitude is
c     -100 (100 East), and a target at bearing 30. will lie on the
c     -70. (70 East) meridian.
c
c     AUTHOR: The core of this subroutine was written by Albion
c             Taylor, another NOAA employee, in 1981.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine performs a bilinear interpolation to get
c     a data value at a given lat/lon that may be anywhere within a box
c     defined by the four surrouding grid points.  In the diagram below,
c     remember that for our grids we are using in the  tracker, the
c     latitude index starts at the north pole and increases southward.
c     The point "X" indicates the target lat/lon location of the value
c     for which we are  bilinearly interpolating.  The values to and ta
c     below are ratios that determine how geographically close the
c     target location is to the point of origin (pt.1 (i,j)) in terms
c     of both longitude (to) and latitude (ta).

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine  sorts storms by mslp.  It is called by
c     subroutine  tracker just before the loop for "stormloop" is done
c     for all the storms at a particular forecast hour.  It is only
c     called for the "midlat" and "tcgen" cases.  The end result of
c     this sort is an array (prsindex) that contains the indeces of
c     the storms, arranged from lowest pressure to highest (and note
c     that the "undefined" storms have a pressure of 9999.99 mb and
c     thus get sorted to the bottom of the array).  The purpose of
c     doing this is so that we track the most intense storms first.
c     Why go to the trouble?  Imagine a scenario in which we are
c     tracking a complex system in which there are 2 low pressure
c     centers.  Let's say that one is becoming dominant and
c     intensifying, while the other is weakening.  Now, let's assume
c     that the weakening one eventually gets absorbed into the
c     stronger, more dominant low.  Now we only have 1 low, but if in
c     the  tracker stormloop, we first process the data for the
c     weakening low, we will attribute the track to that storm, and
c     then when we get to the point in the loop where we are trying
c     to get the track for the stronger storm, we will (erroneously)
c     stop the tracking for that storm since the storm center has
c     already been attributed to the weaker storm.  But by using this
c     subroutine, we will track the stronger storm first, and thus
c     avoid this problem.

c     position (centlon,centlat).  The only trick to this whole

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine  outputs a 1-line message for a given 
c     storm at an input forecast hour in the new ATCF UNIX format.  
c     Unlike the old atcf DOS format in which you waited until the 
c     whole tracking was over to write the  output for all forecast 
c     hours, with this atcfunix format, each time we are calling this
c     subroutine, it is to only write out 1 record, which will be the
c     fix info for a particular storm at a given time.  Also, even 
c     though we have some data (GFS, NAM) at 6-hour intervals, Jim 
c     Gross informed me that TPC does not need the positions at such
c     frequency, and keeping the reporting at 12 hour intervals is fine.
c
c     While this new atcfunix format contains much more information than
c     the old 1-line atcf dos message, for our purposes we will use the
c     slots for mslp and wind radii.  An example set of output records
c     will look like the following:
c
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, GFSO, 036, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  34,
c             NEQ,  242,  163,  124,  208
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, GFSO, 036, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  50,
c             NEQ,  155,  000,  000,  000
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, GFSO, 036, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  64,
c             NEQ,  000,  000,  000,  000
c
c     (NOTE: Each of the above lines beginning with "AL" is output as 
c            a single line of text.)
c
c     Note that in this example, for this 36h forecast hour, there are 
c     3 entries.  This is so that we can include the radii for the 
c     3 different wind thresholds (34kt, 50kt and 64kt).  So the only
c     thing different in each entry is the wind radii info;  all the
c     other info is identical for each entry.
c
c     This message also contains the intensity estimates (in knots) 
c     for every forecast hours  The  conversion for m/s to knots is 
c     to multiply m/s by 1.9427 (3.281 ft/m, 1 naut mile/6080 ft, 
c     3600s/h).
c
c     NOTE: The longitudes that are passed into this subroutine are
c     given in 0 - 360, increasing eastward.  The format for the 
c     atcfunix system requires that the  output be 0-180E or
c     0-180W, so we must adjust the values, if needed.  Also, the
c     values for southern latitudes must be positive (use 'N' and 
c     'S' to distinguish Northern/Southern Hemispheres).

c               which is to be written out to the  output file

c     ist       the number storm that we're processing (can be 1-15)
c     ifcsthr   the current forecast hour being output
c     vmaxwind  the max surface wind for this storm at this fcst hour
c     xminmslp  the min mslp for this storm at this fcst hour

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine  is very similar to subroutine
c     output_atcfunix, however it also writes out additional 
c     parameters on the end that are not part of the standard 
c     ATCF format.  As of March 2022, that includes these parms:
c       
c       850 mb convergence
c       850 mb moisture convergence

c     First convert all of the lat/lon values from reals into integers.
c     These integer values must be 10x their real value (eg. 125.4 will

c     from 0-180E or 0-180W, and convert the lat values so that they are
c     positive and use 'N' or 'S' to differentiate hemispheres.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine  outputs a 1-line message for each
c     storm.  This message contains the model identifier, the forecast
c     initial date, and the positions for 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72
c     hours.  In the case of the regional models (NGM, Eta), which
c     only go out to 48h, zeroes are included for forecast hours
c     60 and 72.
c
c     NOTE: The longitudes that are passed into this subroutine are
c     given in 0 - 360, increasing eastward.  The  output of this
c     subroutine is used by Steve Lord for plotting purposes, and his
c     plotting routines need the longitudes in 0 - 360, increasing
c     westward.  Thus, a necessary adjustment is made.

c     from 0 - 360, increasing westward.
c     Also, because the fixlon value may be >360 due to GM wrapping, we
c     need to mod it to get it in a 0-360 framework.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine  outputs a 1-line message for a given
c     storm at an input forecast hour in a modified ATCF UNIX format.
c     The modification is to allow for sub-hourly output.  That is,
c     instead of just integer output hours, we can have output at 
c     10, 15 or 20 past an hour.  This necessitates a change in the 
c     "forecast hour" placeholder in the ATCF format.  Instead of it
c     being an I3, we'll make it an I5, with something like a lead time
c     of 36.25h being rounded and truncated to 03625 for output.
c     
c     An example set of output records using the standard atcf format
c     looks like the following:
c     
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, AVNO, 036, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  34,
c             NEQ,  242,  163,  124,  208
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, AVNO, 036, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  50,
c             NEQ,  155,  000,  000,  000
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, AVNO, 036, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  64,
c             NEQ,  000,  000,  000,  000
c     
c     An example set of modified output records will look like the
c     following, for the case of a lead time of 36:15 (36.25):
c     
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, AVNO, 03625, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  34,
c             NEQ,  242,  163,  124,  208
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, AVNO, 03625, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  50,
c             NEQ,  155,  000,  000,  000
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, AVNO, 03625, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  64,
c             NEQ,  000,  000,  000,  000
c     
c     (NOTE: Each of the above lines beginning with "AL" is output as
c            a single line of text.)
c     
c     Note that in this example, for this 36h forecast hour, there are
c     3 entries.  This is so that we can include the radii for the
c     3 different wind thresholds (34kt, 50kt and 64kt).  So the only
c     thing different in each entry is the wind radii info;  all the
c     other info is identical for each entry.
c     
c     This message also contains the intensity estimates (in knots)
c     for every forecast hours  The  conversion for m/s to knots is
c     to multiply m/s by 1.9427 (3.281 ft/m, 1 naut mile/6080 ft,
c     3600s/h).
c     
c     NOTE: The longitudes that are passed into this subroutine are
c     given in 0 - 360, increasing eastward.  The format for the
c     atcfunix system requires that the  output be 0-180E or
c     0-180W, so we must adjust the values, if needed.  Also, the
c     values for southern latitudes must be positive (use 'N' and
c     'S' to distinguish Northern/Southern Hemispheres).
c     
c     INPUT:    
c     storm     An array of type tcvcard.  Use this for the storm ID
c     outlon    longitude  fix position for this storm at this time
c               which is to be written out to the  output file
c     outlat    latitude  fix position for this storm at this time
c               which is to be written out to the  output file
c     inp       contains input date and model number information
c     ist       the number storm that we're processing (can be 1-15)
c     ifh       index for the lead time array
c     vmaxwind  the max surface wind for this storm at this fcst hour
c     xminmslp  the min mslp for this storm at this fcst hour
c     vradius   Contains the distance from the storm fix position to
c               each of the various wind threshhold distances in each
c               quadrant. (3,4) ==> (# of threshholds, # of quadrants)
c     rmax      Radius of max winds (n mi).... it was already converted
c               from km to n mi in subroutine  get_max_wind
c
c     OUTPUT:
c     ioaxret   integer return code from this subroutine
c
c     LOCAL:
c     intlon    integer that holds the value of outlon*10
c     intlat    integer that holds the value of outlat*10

c     First convert all of the lat/lon values from reals into integers.
c     These integer values must be 10x their real value (eg. 125.4 will
c     be written out as 1254).  Convert the lon values so that they go
c     from 0-180E or 0-180W, and convert the lat values so that they are
c     positive and use 'N' or 'S' to differentiate hemispheres.
c     Also, because the outlon value may be >360 due to GM wrapping, we
c     need to mod it to get it in a 0-360 framework.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine  outputs a 1-line message for a given
c     storm at an input forecast hour.  This message contains the
c     values for the fractional areal coverage of various wind
c     thresholds.  In addition, this subroutine also writes out
c     records to a file containing data on the PDF of wind magnitudes
c     within r=350 km.
c
c     This format will mimic the current atcfunix format with the
c     difference coming late in the record, where the various wind radii
c     will be replaced with areal coverage thresholds.

c     (NOTE: Each of the above lines beginning with "AL" is output as
c            a single line of text.)
c
c     Note that in this example, for this 36h forecast hour, there are
c     3 entries.  This is so that we can include the pctgs for the
c     3 different wind thresholds (34kt, 50kt and 64kt).  So the only
c     thing different in each entry is the wind pctg info;  all the
c     other info is identical for each entry.
c
c     Listed after the "XX" in each record is the radius from which
c     the coverage is valid (000 km in this case); Next is the radius
c     at which the coverage stops (100 km in this case).  Next is the
c     wind threshold (34, 50, 64).  Next is an identifier for which
c     quadrant the coverage starts in (first 2 characters are NE, SE,
c     SW, NW); the last character indicates if the coverages are
c     computed in the quadrants as earth-relative ("E") or
c     storm-motion relative ("R").  The ones listed there as "AAE"
c     are for the full disc (i.e., 4-quadrant average), earth-relative.
c     Next are the wind coverage percentages, listed as percentage * 10
c     (e.g., 981 = 98.1%).
c
c     This message also contains the intensity estimates (in knots)
c     for every forecast hours  The  conversion for m/s to knots is
c     to multiply m/s by 1.9427 (3.281 ft/m, 1 naut mile/6080 ft,
c     3600s/h).
c
c     NOTE: The longitudes that are passed into this subroutine are
c     given in 0 - 360, increasing eastward.  The format for the
c     atcfunix system requires that the  output be 0-180E or
c     0-180W, so we must adjust the values, if needed.  Also, the
c     values for southern latitudes must be positive (use 'N' and
c     'S' to distinguish Northern/Southern Hemispheres).

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine  outputs a 1-line message for a given
c     storm at an input forecast hour.  This message contains the
c     values of the winds at specified distances along 45-degree
c     radials in each storm quadrant.  These are  output
c     twice -- First, for an earth-relative coordinate system, and
c     second, for a storm-relative coordinate system.  For the
c     earth-relative estimates, we will always have 4 radials: NE, SE,
c     SW and NW (45,135,225,315).  For the storm-relative estimates,
c     these radials will be computed at the same relative angles (i.e.,
c     45,135,225,315), but with respect (positive clockwise) to the
c     direction of storm motion.  For example, for a storm moving with
c     a heading of 280, the wind structure is evaluated at these
c     radials: 325 (front-right; 45 deg CW from heading), 55 (back-
c     right; 135 deg CW from heading), 145 (back-left; 225 deg CW from
c     heading), 235 (front-left; 315 deg CW from heading).

c
c     This message also contains the intensity estimates (in knots)
c     for every forecast hour.  The  conversion for m/s to knots is

c
c     NOTE: The longitudes that are passed into this subroutine are

c     from 0-180E or 0-180W, and convert the lat values so that they are
c     positive and use 'N' or 'S' to differentiate hemispheres.
c     Also, because the outlon value may be >360 due to GM wrapping, we

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine  outputs a 1-line message for a given
c     storm at an input forecast hour.  This message contains the values
c     for the Integrated Kinetic Energy (IKE) and Storm Surge Damage
c     Potential (SDP), based on Powell (BAMS, 2007).  At this time, we
c     are only computing the IKE values for TS threshold (17.5 m/s) and
c     above.  We are not yet computing wind damage potential (WDP)
c     since, per Mark Powell (4/2008), he is currently re-formulating
c     an algorithm for it.
c
c     LOCAL:
c
c     Arrays:
c
c     ike   Integrated kinetic energy:
c           ike(1) = IKE_10m/s  (storm energy)
c           ike(2) = IKE_18m/s  (IKE_ts, tropical storm)
c           ike(3) = IKE_33m/s  (IKE_h,  hurricane)
c           ike(4) = IKE_25_40 m/s  (Not currently computed)
c           ike(5) = IKE_41_54 m/s  (Not currently computed)
c           ike(6) = IKE_55 m/s     (Not currently computed)
c
c
c     The format used will mimic the current atcfunix format with the
c     difference coming late in the record, where the various wind radii
c     will be replaced with WDP, SDP and IKE values:
c
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, AVNO, 036, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  91,
c             IKE,  340,  560,  212,  174,   42,   93,   12,    0
c
c     Where the places are identified as follows:
c
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, AVNO, 036, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  91,
c             IKE,  WDP,  SDP,  I10,  ITS,  IH ,I2540,I4154,  I55
c
c     (NOTE: Each of the above lines beginning with "AL" is output as
c            a single line of text.)
c
c     Values for WDP and SDP are multiplied by 10 in this routine
c     before being written out.
c
c     This message also contains the intensity estimates (in knots)
c     for every forecast hour.  The  conversion for m/s to knots is
c     to multiply m/s by 1.9427 (3.281 ft/m, 1 naut mile/6080 ft,
c     3600s/h).
c
c     NOTE: The longitudes that are passed into this subroutine are
c     given in 0 - 360, increasing eastward.  The format for the
c     atcfunix system requires that the  output be 0-180E or
c     0-180W, so we must adjust the values, if needed.  Also, the
c     values for southern latitudes must be positive (use 'N' and
c     'S' to distinguish Northern/Southern Hemispheres).
c
c     INPUT:
c     storm     An array of type tcvcard.  Use this for the storm ID
c     outlon    longitude  fix position for this storm at this time
c               which is to be written out to the  output file

c     xsfclat   low-level latitude estimate for this storm & time,
c               computed ideally from mean of mslp & low-level winds.
c     inp       contains input date and model number information
c     ist       the number storm that we're processing (can be 1-15)
c     ifcsthr   the current forecast hour being output
c     vmaxwind  the max surface wind for this storm at this fcst hour

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine  outputs a 1-line message for a given
c     storm at an input forecast hour.  This message contains the values
c     for the three parameters that comprise Bob Hart's cyclone phase
c     space (CPS).  These parameters are his "parameter B", which
c     assesses the left-right thermal asymmetry, and the upper
c     troposphere (300-600 mb) and lower troposphere (900-600 mb)
c     thermal wind values.

c     difference coming late in the record, where the various wind radii
c     will be replaced with paramb, vtl_slope and vtu_slope values:

c
c     This message also contains the intensity estimates (in knots)
c     for every forecast hour.  The  conversion for m/s to knots is
c     to multiply m/s by 1.9427 (3.281 ft/m, 1 naut mile/6080 ft,
c     3600s/h).
c
c     NOTE: The longitudes that are passed into this subroutine are
c     given in 0 - 360, increasing eastward.  The format for the
c     atcfunix system requires that the  output be 0-180E or
c     0-180W, so we must adjust the values, if needed.  Also, the
c     values for southern latitudes must be positive (use 'N' and

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine  outputs a 1-line message for a given 
c     storm at an input forecast hour in a modified atcfunix format.  
c     The reason that it's called "modified" is that the format is 
c     slightly different from the standard TPC-accepted atcfunix 
c     format that they use for TCs.  Specifically, the first part that
c     identifies the storm is different.  Here's an example of the 
c     TPC standard atcfunix format:
c
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, GFSO, 036, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  34,
c             NEQ,  242,  163,  124,  208
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, GFSO, 036, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  50,
c             NEQ,  155,  000,  000,  000
c     AL, 13, 2000092500, 03, GFSO, 036, 243N, 675W, 42, 995, XX,  64,
c             NEQ,  000,  000,  000,  000
c
c     (NOTE: Each of the above lines beginning with "AL" is output as 
c            a single line of text.... they're just broken up into 2 
c            lines here for readability.)
c
c     Here's an example of the modified output format for the same 
c     storm.  Note that the lat/lon identifier in the new storm id at
c     the beginning of the record is different from that shown later
c     in the record.  The reason is that the lat/lon identifier will
c     be the one that is pulled from the tcvitals or gen_vitals 
c     record:
c
c     2000092500_230N_0658W_13L, 2000092500, 03, GFSO, 036, 243N, 675W,
c             42, 995, XX,  34, NEQ,  242,  163,  124,  208
c     2000092500_230N_0658W_13L, 2000092500, 03, GFSO, 036, 243N, 675W,
c             42, 995, XX,  50, NEQ,  155,  000,  000,  000
c     2000092500_230N_0658W_13L, 2000092500, 03, GFSO, 036, 243N, 675W,
c             42, 995, XX,  64, NEQ,  000,  000,  000,  000
c
c
c     Note that in this example, for this 36h forecast hour, there are 
c     3 entries.  This is so that we can include the radii for the 
c     3 different wind thresholds (34kt, 50kt and 64kt).  So the only
c     thing different in each entry is the wind radii info;  all the
c     other info is identical for each entry.
c
c     This message also contains the intensity estimates (in knots) 
c     for every forecast hours  The  conversion for m/s to knots is 
c     to multiply m/s by 1.9427 (3.281 ft/m, 1 naut mile/6080 ft, 
c     3600s/h).
c
c     NOTE: The longitudes that are passed into this subroutine are
c     given in 0 - 360, increasing eastward.  The format for the 
c     atcfunix system requires that the  output be 0-180E or
c     0-180W, so we must adjust the values, if needed.  Also, the
c     values for southern latitudes must be positive (use 'N' and 
c     'S' to distinguish Northern/Southern Hemispheres).

      conv_ms_knots = 1.9427

      endif

c     Unlike the regular atcfunix output, in which we  output a record
c     at forecast time = 00h even if the storm cannot be found, here
c     we don't want to do that.  So check the lat & lon positions and
c     exit this subroutine now if they're both zero.

c     Initially, set all "gstm" components equal to the input "gstorm"
c     components for this storm, then we will change the specific

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine  outputs a modified vitals record.  
c     The lat/lon location is given by the xlon and xlat that are
c     input to this subroutine.
c
c     The reason that these are referred to as modified tcvitals is
c     that the format is different from standard TC vitals format.
c     The storm identifier is different than that for a standard 
c     tcvitals.  The storm identifier contains the date/time that 
c     the storm was first identified, and the lat/lon position at
c     which it was first identified.
c
c     EXAMPLE:  The following is a standard TC Vitals record, split
c               up over 3 lines:

c     EXAMPLE:  The following is the format for the "genesis" vitals,

c
c     EXAMPLE:  If the vitals record is for a non-officially numbered
c               system (i.e., any system that's not a TC being tracked
c               by NHC or JTWC), then the storm number is replaced

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine  outputs a GRIB record that contains the
c     "mask" used to mask out areas surrounding low pressure centers 
c     that have been found during the search at each forecast hour. This
c     mask is written out purely for diagnostic purposes.  The GRIB 
c     identifier given to the mask in the pds is 850 mb height (you can 
c     make it anything you want).  This is only done for the "midlat"
c     and "tcgen" cases, since the runs for those cases use a mask while
c     the regular "tracker" run (that is, the run which strictly tracks
c     only those storms in the TC vitals file) does not.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine calculates a guess position for the next
c               forecast time.  It does this by using two different 
c               methods and averaging the results from those two.  The
c               first method is a simple linear extrapolation made by
c               basically drawing a line from the previous position 
c               through the current fix position and assuming straight
c               line motion.  The second method is to do a barnes 
c               smoothing of u & v in the vicinity of the storm at 850, 
c               700 & 500 mb to get an average environmental wind 
c               vector at each level, and then move the storm according 
c               to the vector at each level.  Then a weighted average is
c               taken of all these positions from methods 1 & 2 to get 
c               the consensus for the guess position.  NOTE: For a 
c               regional model and a storm that is relatively close to
c               the model boundary, there is a strong possibility that
c               the  barnes analysis subroutine will fail due to trying
c               to access grid points beyond the model's lateral  
c               boundary.  In this case, the redlm & ridlm are halved
c               and barnes is called again.  If it still fails, then 
c               just use the result from method 1 as a default.

c             for general tracking.  In the case of vitals, eventually
c             in the  barnes subroutine we are more lax and allow the 
c             routine to keep searching even if we are close to the 
c             grid boundary.  In a general tracking search, if we hit
c             the grid boundary even just once, we exit.

c     dtkm    Distance in meters of 1 degree latitude
c     icutmax Max number of times to cut the ridlm and redlm in half,
c             for use in calling barnes.  If you're using a regional
c             model and on the first call to barnes you try to access
c             a point that's outside the model grid boundary, we'll
c             call  barnes again, but not before cutting the redlm and
c             ridlm in half.  icutmax says how many times to allow 
c             this cutting in half before giving up and just going
c             with the extrapolation method.  At first writing, we'll
c             set icutmax to 2, so that it will allow the ridlm to 
c             get down to 500 km (originally 2000 km) and the redlm 
c             to 125 km (originally 500 km).
c         *** NOTE: After testing the system, it was found that if
c             we cut these radii, the u and v values that are 
c             calculated from barnes are too strongly influenced by
c             the near-storm environment and, especially for asymmetric
c             systems, resulted in u and v values being much too strong.
c             As such, we will not allow these values to be cut, and if
c             we hit the boundaries in barnes, we'll just use the 
c             extrapolation method, which has seemed to work just fine.

c       distance (km) the storm travelled in the x-direction (at an
c       average latitude between the current and previous latitudes),
c       and then add that distance on to the current longitude and 
c       convert that distance to the num of degrees the storm has 
c       travelled in the x-direction (at an average latitude between
c       the current and next(extrap) latitudes).

c       UPDATE Feb 2009: To account for the possibility of using
c       irregularly spaced forecast hours (e.g., 6,10,10.5,...etc),
c       I had to modify this linear extrapolation.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine calculates a guess position for the next
c     forecast time.  It is called for a couple different cases, one in
c     which we've got NetCDF data and no hour0 data, and the other is 
c     for any case in which the storm can't be found at 00h, and so we 
c     assume there may be an issue at 00h with the storm initialization, 
c     and we will give the  tracker one more try at the next lead time
c     to try and track the storm.
c    
c     We simply take the TC Vitals data and advect the current position
c     to a position at the next lead time.  We can't use the code in 
c     subroutine  get_next_ges because there are certain allocatable 
c     arrays in that subroutine that need to have been allocated first, 
c     and at this point prior to the first lead time in hour0, they 
c     haven't been allocated.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine looks through the wind data near an
c     input storm center (fixlon,fixlat) and gets the radii of various
c     surface winds in each of the 4 storm quadrants (NE,NW,SE,SW).  
c     The wind thresholds that are sought are gale force (34kt|17.5m/s),
c     storm force (50kt|25.7m/s), and hurricane force (64kt|32.9m/s). 
c     This subroutine calls the Cray subroutine  orders, which is a 
c     Cray-optimized sort routine.
c
c     UPDATE (AUG 2001): The Cray subroutine  orders was ported to the
c     SP by NCEP personnel.  On the SP version, some changes were
c     apparently made so that the size of the arrays for calling
c     arguments 2, 3 and 4 (iwork, dtemp and isortix in my calling
c     routine) must be the same.  This was not the case on the Crays,
c     and this was causing the  tracker to crash for cases far north
c     on fine grids (GFDL 1/3 grid).
c
c     UPDATE (AUG 2012): The call to the Cray subroutine orders was
c     replaced with a call to qsort, which uses a quicksort sorting
c     algorithm.  While this is not the fastest sorting routine out
c     there, we don't do a lot of sorting here, and qsort is simple
c     and it is portable.
c
c     UPDATE (April 2013):  For the radii, we encountered a problem with
c     radmax being too small.  It was set at 650 km.  Hurricane Sandy
c     exceeded this in the models, so the values returned from getradii
c     were close to the default radmax value of 650 km (350 nm), instead
c     of much higher as they should have been.  To fix it, we now use an
c     iterative technique, where we start with radmax as a small value
c     (450 km).  If getradii returns a value for R34 in a quadrant that
c     does not exceed 0.97*radmax, then that value is ok.  If it does
c     exceed 0.97*radmax, then we bump up radmax by 50 km and call
c     getradii again, looking to diagnose radii only in those quadrants
c     where the need_to_expand_r34 flag = 'n'.

c           thresh category when going from 1 grid point to the next, so
c           we need to account for this.  For example, if 1 point has
c           vmag = 15 m/s and the next point closer in has vmag = 28 
c           m/s, then between those 2 points you have the thresholds
c           for gale force AND storm force winds, so to be safe, we
c           actually need to add 1 to ipoint and re-check the current 
c           point, if the wind value at that point is found to be 
c           greater than a wind threshold value (which it has if you've

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine looks through the wind data near an
c     input storm center (fixlon,fixlat) and gets the radii of various
c     surface winds in each of the 4 storm quadrants (NE,NW,SE,SW).  
c     The wind thresholds that are sought are gale force (34kt|17.5m/s),
c     storm force (50kt|25.7m/s), and hurricane force (64kt|32.9m/s). 
c
c     This subroutine is a new version,created in May 2022, in response
c     to feedback from EMC and GFDL modeling groups.  Their input was
c     that for newer, hi-res, FV3-based regional models (HAFS-A and 
c     T-SHiELD), the current wind radii scheme was detecting grid points
c     that were isolated outliers and diagnosing the R34 values as being
c     out at those extended radii.  I had discussions with NHC folks, 
c     who concurred that those isolated outliers should not be
c     considered as part of the mean circulation of the storm.  I then
c     spoke with John Knaff, who said that his group at STAR had run
c     into similar issues with diagnosing R34 from Synthetic Aperture
c     Radar (SAR) winds.  So what they do is analyze the wind in
c     radial bands and assign a value for each band, but instead of 
c     using the max wind value in each band, they use the 95th 
c     percentile value.  I am going to try an additional constraint,
c     whereby the mean tangential wind is also calculated in each 
c     radial band, and if that mean Vt falls below a threshold for 
c     more than a few bands (i.e., a distance of ~10-15 km), then the
c     diagnosed R34 cannot be permitted to extend beyond that distance,
c     either.
c
c     As for the diagnosis scheme itself, it will be done in the same
c     way as previously done for the original getradii subroutine,
c     where I work from the outside in, until I hit a band with a 95th
c     percentile wind value >= 34 kts.  But then, according to the new
c     method, I will need to make sure that the mean Vt in that band
c     is cyclonic and exceeds a threshold value

          ! In this next section, we are determining the wind value in
          ! representative of the radial bin, using the radii_percentile
          ! that the user entered in the namelist as our guideline.
          ! I.e., if the user set radii_percentile = 95% in the
          ! namelist, then we look through all of those 90 interpolated
          ! wind values that we just created above and we select the
          ! 95th percentile wind.  And because that 95th percentile may
          ! actually fall in between two points, there is some
          ! interpolation that we have to do (described more below).
          !
          ! Only continue with the radii calculation for this 
          ! quadrant if ALL of the points in this radial band have valid
          ! wind data.
          !
          ! Interpolate to get the value at the exact threshold that
          ! was requested.
          !
          ! radii_pctile = Percentile wind threshold value in a radial
          !             bin that the user has requested.
          ! target_slot = The spot in the order of wind values that 
          !             will be used for the percentile wind value.
          !             For example, if the user wants the 95th 
          !             percentile wind value, we have (assuming no
          !             points lost to running into a regional 
          !             boundary) 0.95 * 90 (because 90 points in
          !             each quadrant radial band) = 85.5... and 
          !             point 85.5 in the array is our target_slot,
          !             meaning that we have to interpolate in
          !             between sorted array positions 85 and 86
          !             to get our representative 95th percentile
          !             wind value for this radial band.

          !             *below* the REAL value of target_slot, and
          !             then for the interpolation we bracket this

c             The possibility exists, especially for coarse  output

c             thresh category when going from 1 grid point to the next,
c             so we need to account for this.  For example, if 1 point
c             has vmag = 15 m/s and the next point closer in has
c             vmag = 28 m/s, then between those 2 points you have the
c             thresholds for gale force AND storm force winds, so to be
c             safe, we actually need to add 1 to ipoint and re-check the
c             current point, if the wind value at that point is found to
c             be greater than a wind threshold value (which it has if
c             you've gotten to this point in threshloop).

c     max wind speed in m/s, which are the units the data are stored in.
c     However, when the max wind values are  output in output_atcf, they
c     will be converted from m/s to knots.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine calculates the axisymmetric RMW (ARMW),
c     as opposed to the gridpoint RMW that was found in subroutine
c     get_max_wind.  We will compute the mean wind in bands that are 
c     3-km wide, extending from 0 out to 125 km for a first pass.  The
c     max value is determined, then a check is done to ensure that the 
c     integral of dV/dr > 0 going out to the diagnosed ARMW, and then
c     the integral of dV/dr < 0 going outward from the ARMW.  If these
c     do not, then we will shift the search range to go from 75 km out
c     to 200 km, check again, and if still needed, try up to two more
c     times with ranges of 150-275 km and then 225-350 km.  Note that
c     we do not have to worry about sign of the winds for NHem vs. 
c     SHem as we do in the wind structure routines, which deal with 
c     tangential winds.  Here, we are just concerned with wind
c     magnitude.
c
c     NOTE: As of May 2022, the units returned from this subroutine are
c     in km for axisymet_rmw_dist and m/s for axisymet_rmw_val.  Both 
c     of those values are converted in output_atcfunix, for km-->nmi
c     and m/s-->kts.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine loops through the different parameters
c               for the input storm number (ist) and calculates the 
c               center position of the storm by taking an average of
c               the center positions obtained for those parameters.
c               First we check to see which parameters are within a 
c               max error range (errmax), and we discard those that are
c               not within that range.  Of the remaining parms, we get 
c               a mean position, and then we re-calculate the position
c               by giving more weight to those estimates that are closer
c               to this mean first-guess position estimate.
c
c     INPUT:
c     clon     Center longitudes of tracked parms for this storm & ifh
c     clat     Center latitudes of tracked parms for this storm & ifh
c     ist      Storm number
c     ifh      Index for forecast hour
c     calcparm Logical; Use this parm's location for this storm or not
c     geslon   Initial guess longitude for this storm at this fcst hour
c     geslat   Initial guess latitude for this storm at this fcst hour
c     inp      contains the input date and model number information
c     xvalues  The actual max or min data values for each parameter
c     maxstorm max # of storms to be handled in this run
c
c     INPUT/OUTPUT:
c     stderr   Standard deviation of the position "error" of the parms
c              relative to the guess storm position.  As long as the 
c              distance of a parm center to the guess center is <=
c              errpmax, it is included in the std dev calculation.
c
c     OUTPUT:
c     fixlon   Best approximation of storm center's longitude
c     fixlat   Best approximation of storm center's latitude
c     ifret    Return code from this subroutine
c
c     LOCAL:
c     storm       Contains tcvitals info for the storms (def_vitals)
c     trkerr_avg  Sum/avg of the track errors for all parms for this
c                 fcst hour, regardless of whether or not the error was
c                 > errmax.  It's used for getting the std deviation of
c                 the position error for this forecast time, to be used
c                 as part of the errmax calculation for the next fcst 
c                 time.
c     iclose      Number of parameters whose position estimates are 
c                 found to be within a distance errmax of the guess pos
c     wtpos       The weight given to each position estimate.  It's 
c                 based on the distance from the average position.
c     errdist     The "error" of the parameter center position relative
c                 to the storm's guess position.
c     avgerr      Average "error" of the parameter center positions
c                 relative to the storm's guess position.
c     use4next    Logical; If a parm center has been calculated but its
c                 distance from the guess position is > errmax, we don't
c                 use this center in calculating the new guess position,
c                 however we will use this position in calculating the 
c                 standard deviation of the current time's guess 
c                 positions, to be used in calculating the new errmax 
c                 for the next forecast time.  So in this subroutine,
c                 calcparm may be set to FALSE if errdist > errmax, but
c                 use4next will not be set to FALSE (Actually, it is 
c                 only set to FALSE if errdist > errpmax, which is 
c                 defined in error_parms and is roughly 600km).
c     stderr_close  Standard deviation of position errors for parms that
c                 have center estimates that are within a distance 
c                 errmax of the guess position.
c     clon_fguess These are the first-guess mean position estimates, 
c     clat_fguess which are the means of the position estimates that
c                 are within a distance errmax.  These first-guess mean
c                 positions will be refined by giving more weight to
c                 individual parameter estimates that are closer to 
c                 this first-guess mean position.
c     dist_from_mean Contains the "error" distance of each parameter
c                 from the first-guess mean position (clon_fguess,
c                 clat_fguess).  NOTE: If a parameter is not within
c                 a distance errmax of the guess position for this
c                 time (geslon,geslat), then there will be NO 
c                 dist_from_mean calculated for that parm.

c     We need to judge whether each parameter position is reasonable,
c     so we'll check to make sure that the dist from each parameter's 
c     estimate to the guess position is less than a maximum allowable 
c     error. If it's the first forecast time, use the initial error max 
c     (defined as errinit in error_parms) as errmax.  Otherwise, the 
c     max error criterion is that the distance error must not exceed 3 
c     times the previous forecast time's standard deviation (after a 
c     small growth factor has been applied).
c     UPDATE 3/5/98: During testing, it was found that just using the
c     previous time's stdev made errmax too "jumpy" (i.e., at vt=48h,
c     errmax could = 380, and then at vt=54h, errmax could jump down
c     to 190, so we've changed it so that it uses an average of the 
c     stdev's from the 3 previous forecast times to maintain some
c     continuity between successive forecast times).

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine calculates the center fix position for
c     the wind circulation near the storm center.  This center fix is 
c     done differently than for the other parms.  With this fix,
c     we limit the area that is searched.  This subroutine is not
c     called until center fixes have been made for the 5 other parms
c     (z850, z700, zeta850, zeta700, mslp).  Once those  fixes have been
c     made, a modified first guess is made of the average of the 
c     original guess position for this lead time and the 5 other parm 
c     fixes that have already been made for this lead time.  That 
c     modified guess position is passed into this subroutine as uvgeslon
c     and uvgeslat, and that's where the searching for the wind 
c     circulation is centered.
c
c     This subroutine works by converting the winds to Vt and Vr at 
c     each grid point evaluated, relative to each candidate center point
c     that is being evaluated at the time in the loop.  We then compute
c     the circulation at each of 24 azimuths surrounding the storm 
c     center, where circulation = Vt * (length of a 1/24 arc, in meters)
c     This process is repeated for 7 successive radii and the results 
c     are summed up over all radii, approximating a solid disk 
c     circulation.  The point at which the circulation is maximized 
c     (NHEM) or minimized (SHEM) is the center of circulation.

c         Make sure that the point being investigated here as a
c         potential center has valid data at that point.  That is, for
c         some hires regional grids that have been rotated/converted
c         from a non-latlon grid to a latlon grid, there can be
c         locations within the (i,j) space that do not have valid data
c         at them. It makes no sense to consider a point such as this
c         as a potential center.
c         There is another simpler case here that we are watching out
c         for.  This is simply the case, again for model data where we
c         only have the innermost nest.  Depending on what we choose
c         for the variable "rads" above, with the way that "npts" is
c         defined for these iloops and jloops that we're in, we may be
c         searching over points that are simply well off the grid.
c         Therefore, it is critical to run through this
c         check_valid_point subroutine to make sure that we're not
c         going to inadvertantly be performing an analysis at one of
c         these "off-grid" points.  So.... if the return code from
c         check_valid_point comes back non-zero, simply cycle iloop

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine calculates the center fix position for
c     the minimum in the wind speed near the storm center.  This center
c     fix is done differently than for the other parms.  With this fix,
c     we severely limit the area that is searched, because we do not 
c     want to confuse a wind minimum out on the periphery of a storm 
c     with the center wind minimum.  Therefore, this subroutine is not
c     called until center fixes have been made for the 5 other parms
c     (z850, z700, zeta850, zeta700, mslp).  Once those  fixes have been
c     made, a modified first guess is made of the average of the guess
c     position for this time and the 5 other parm fixes.  That modified
c     guess position is passed into this subroutine as uvgeslon and 
c     uvgeslat, and that's where the searching for the wind minimum 
c     is done.  To get the wind minimum, the u and v data are first 
c     interpolated down to a fine grid (see details below for exact
c     figures), and then a single-pass barnes analysis is done on that
c     fine grid.  The reason that we first interpolate the data (which
c     is different from how we do the other parms) is that if we just 
c     use the original grid resolution, we may not be able to 
c     accurately pick out a minimum in the wind field at the center.

c     ABSTRACT: The purpose of this subroutine is to get a modified 
c               first guess lat/lon position before searching for the 
c               minimum in the wind field.  The reason for doing this is
c               to better refine the guess and avoid picking up a wind
c               wind minimum far away from the center.  So, use the 
c               first guess position (and give it strong weighting), and
c               then also use the  fix positions for the current time
c               (give the vorticity centers stronger weighting as well),
c               and then take the average of these positions.
c
c     INPUT:
c     guesslon  guess longitude for this forecast time 
c     guesslat  guess latitude for this forecast time 
c     clon      array with center longitude  fixes for the various parms
c     clat      array with center latitude  fixes for the various parms
c     calcparm  logical; tells whether or not a parm has a valid fix
c                   at this forecast hour
c     ist       index for current storm
c     ifh       index for current forecast hour
c     maxstorm  max # of storms that can be handled
c
c     OUTPUT:
c     uvgeslon  contains modified guess longitude position at which to
c                   look for the wind minimum
c     uvgeslat  contains modified guess latitude position at which to

c     This routine  finds the location (clon,clat) of and value of the
c     the max or min of fxy in the vicinity of slon,slat.  The value of
c     the input flag maxmin determines whether to look for a max or a
c     min value.  The max/min is determined by finding the point which 
c     gives the max/min value of a single point barnes analysis of fxy 
c     with e-folding radius re (km) and influence radius ri (km). The 
c     initial search is restricted to a radius rads around the point 
c     (slon,slat) on a grid with lon,lat spacing dx and dy. The location
c     is refined by reducing the spacing of the search grid by a factor
c     of two, nhalf times.

c     UPDATE DEC 2009: For the HFIP HRH testing, it was found that 
c     due to the very limited domain size of some of the models, the

c     to erroneously be selected as the center point.  We add in a

c       NOTE: The maxvgrid variable determines what size grid to send

c             8x8 grid; maxvgrid = 12 means send a 12x12 grid.  For 
c             ultra-fine mesh grids (finer than 0.04 deg, or 1/25 deg),

c     If input parm is vmag, we've already done the minimizing by

c     as boundaries for the array to search.  For all other parms, 
c     however, no minimizing has been done yet, so we need to call

c         Make sure that the point being investigated here as a

c         some hires regional grids that have been rotated/converted
c         from a non-latlon grid to a latlon grid, there can be
c         locations within the (i,j) space that do not have valid data
c         at them. It makes no sense to consider a point such as this
c         as a potential center.
c         There is another simpler case here that we are watching out
c         for.  This is simply the case, again for model data where we
c         only have the innermost nest.  Depending on what we choose
c         for the variable "rads" above, with the way that "npts" is
c         defined for these iloops and jloops that we're in, we may be
c         searching over points that are simply well off the grid.
c         Therefore, it is critical to run through this
c         check_valid_point subroutine to make sure that we're not
c         going to inadvertantly be performing an analysis at one of
c         these "off-grid" points.  So.... if the return code from

          if (cparm == 'vmag') then

c           This next bit of code gets the ij coordinates for an 8x8 
c           box around the current point under consideration. These ij
c           coordinates are sent to barnes so that barnes only loops 
c           64 times, as opposed to nearly 10,000 if the whole 97x97

c           northward of rlatt and fix rlont to the grid point just

c           barnes analysis in that we're  sort of specifying ahead of
c           time exactly which grid points will be included and we'll
c           be excluding some points that would be near the periphery
c           of each (rlont,rlatt)'s range, but as long as we're consis-
c           tent and do it this way for each point, it's well worth the
c           trade-off in cpu time.  Parameter maxvgrid determines what 
c           size array to send to barnes (maxvgrid=8 means 8x8)

c     Through interpolation, the grid for vmag has already been
c     minimized considerably, we don't need to go through the 2nd part
c     of this subroutine, which halves the grid spacing.

      if (nhalf < 1 .or. cparm == 'vmag') then
        if (maxmin == 'max') then

c     If on our first pass through, we were dealing with a regional grid
c     that straddled the GM, then it becomes (for now) too much of a
c     coding hassle to deal with in the rest of this routine (i.e., in
c     all the nhalf iterations), so we will just go with the first run
c     through for the center fix and exit the routine.

      if (grid_minlon > 330. .and. grid_maxlon < 30.) then
        if (maxmin == 'max') then

c     -------------------------------------------------------------
c     If the grid spacing is
c     fine enough (I've chosen 0.2-deg as a min threshold), there is
c     no need to halve the grid more than 3 times, as halving a 
c     0.2-deg grid 3 times gives a resolution of 0.025-deg (2.7 km),
c     or a max error in the position estimate of 2.7/2 = 1.35 km.

      if ((dx+dy)/2. <= 0.2) then
        if ((dx+dy)/2. <= 0.05) then

c     ABSTRACT: This routine performs a single-pass barnes anaylsis
c     of fxy at the point (flon,flat). The e-folding radius (km)
c     and influence radius (km) are re and ri, respectively.
c
c     NOTE:  The input grid that is searched in this subroutine is most
c     likely NOT the model's full, original grid.  Instead, a smaller
c     subgrid of the original grid is searched.  The upper left and 
c     lower right grid point indices are passed into this subroutine 
c     (iibeg, jjbeg, iiend, jjend) for this subgrid.  These indices are
c     determined in the subroutine  get_ij_bounds, and the purpose of 
c     doing it this way is to limit the number of points for which the
c     subroutine has to calculate distances (for a global 1 deg grid,
c     the number of loop iterations is reduced from 65160 to somewhere
c     around 600).
c
c     NOTE: This subroutine will ignore the data at grid points where 
c     there is no valid data.  This would happen in the case of a
c     regional grid, if you try to access a point near the edge of the
c     grid (remember that because of the interpolation for the regional
c     grids, there will be areas around the edges that have no valid
c     data).
c
c     INPUT:
c     flon    Lon value for center point about which barnes anl is done
c     flat    Lat value for center point about which barnes anl is done
c     rlon    Array of lon values for each grid point
c     rlat    Array of lat values for each grid point
c     iimax   Max number of pts in x-direction on input grid
c     jjmax   Max number of pts in y-direction on input grid
c     iibeg   i index for grid point to start barnes anlysis (upp left)
c     jjbeg   j index for grid point to start barnes anlysis (upp left)
c     iiend   i index for last grid point in barnes anlysis (low right)
c     jjend   j index for last grid point in barnes anlysis (low right)
c     fxy     Real array of data on which to perform barnes analysis
c     defined_pt Logical; bitmap array used for regional grids
c     bskip   integer to indicate number of grid points to skip during
c             a barnes loop, in order to speed processing
c     re      input e-folding radius for barnes analysis
c     ri      input influence radius for searching for min/max
c     ctype   character that lets subroutine know if this is a search
c             for the next position for the purposes of tc vitals or
c             for general tracking.  In the case of vitals, in
c             this barnes subroutine we are more lax and allow the
c             routine to keep searching even if we are close to the
c             grid boundary.  In a general tracking search, if we hit
c             the grid boundary even just once, we exit.

c     ABSTRACT: This routine performs a single-pass barnes anaylsis
c     of fxy at the point (flon,flat)...  Just like the original 
c     subroutine  barnes.  The only difference is that this routine 
c     is meant for SST and will contain an additional check for the 
c     land-sea mask.  While it would have been easy to code that into
c     the original barnes subroutine, I didn't want to check 
c     for land/sea since that routine is the core of the  tracker
c     program, it gets called zillions of times for other purposes,
c     and I don't want to slow it down at all with extra code.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine figures out, based on ri, dx and dy and
c     the guess latitude and longitude positions, the farthest reaching
c     grid points that are searchable by an analysis subroutine.  The
c     purpose is to return indices for a subgrid that is much smaller 
c     than the original, full grid.  This smaller subgrid can then be 
c     passed to a subsequent analysis or interpolation subroutine, and 
c     work can be done on this smaller array.  This can help save time, 
c     especially in the  barnes analysis subroutine, as work will only 
c     be done on, say, a 20 x 20 array (400 pts) instead of on a 
c     360 x 181 array (65160 pts).  It's crucial, however, to make sure 
c     that the ibeg, jbeg, iend and jend are extended far enough out to 
c     fully encompass any search that would be done.  Below is a 
c     diagram showing the different grids....

c     If nhalf > 0: This occurs in the case of a call from fmax, when
c     the grid spacing is halved nhalf times.  In this case, we have to
c     do extra work to figure out the maximum possible grid point.  For
c     this case:

c                  edge of Grid B in above diagram), plus a cushion.

c
c     If nhalf = 0: In this case, the grid spacing will not be reduced,
c     so the number of pts in j direction from x to the edge of Grid
c     B will be the input parameter npts, and just multiply it by 2,
c     and add 2 for a cushion to get jmaxlatpts.  Typically, this sub
c     is called from find_maxmin, and in that sub, the first time that
c     this sub is called, nhalf will = 0.  Then, after a first-shot
c     center is found, the grid spacing will be cut in order to rerun 
c     barnes on a smaller grid, and that's when nhalf will be sent 
c     here as 3.

c     April, 2007: A min statement was put on the calculation to
c     derive dlon, since with that cosine in there, the values of
c     of dlon could get pretty ridiculous as you approach the poles.
c     Also, the cosine factor (cosfac) used to be computed at the
c     most poleward latitude possible given the jend here.  For

c     when calculating the distance between 2 identical points (should
c     = 0), but the input for ACOS was just slightly over 1
c     (e.g., 1.00000000007), due to (I'm guessing) rounding errors.

c     NOTE: whether this subroutine returns the value of the distance
c           in km or m depends on the scale of the parameter ecircum.

c           was given in km.

      subroutine get_grib_file_name (ifh,gfilename,ifilename)

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine uses various input regarding the model
c     and forecast hour and generates the name of the input grib file
c     for this particular forecast hour.  Remember that the lead time
c     is in minutes and that 5 spaces must be reserved for the lead
c     time (e.g., f00360).  File name should be something that looks
c     like either, e.g., "gfdl.6thdeg.katrina12l.2005082818.f00720",
c     or "gfdl.6thdeg.2005082818.f00720" (the part in there with the
c     storm name & ID is optional).  The grib index file name should
c     be exactly the same as the grib data file itself, but with the

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine reads the input GRIB file for the
c     tracked parameters.  It then calls subroutines to convert the
c     data from a 1-d array into a 2-d array if the read was successful.
c
c     There are up to 9 fields that are read in that will be used to
c     locate the storm position.  There are an additional 4 variables
c     (500 mb u- and v-components and 10 m u- and v- components) that
c     will not be used for tracking, but only for helping to estimate
c     the next first guess position (500 mb winds) and for estimating
c     the max near-surface wind speeds in the vicinity of the storm
c     (10 m winds).
c
c     Fields read in are listed here.  Numbers indicate positioning in
c     the readflag logical array:
c
c     1.   850 mb absolute vorticity
c     2.   700 mb absolute vorticity

c     12.  500 mb u-component
c     13.  500 mb v-component
c     14.  300-500 mb mean temperature (I jerry-rigged this by storing
c               the data as being at the 401 mb level.)
c     15.  500 mb geopotential height
c     16.  200 mb geopotential height
c     17.  Land-Sea mask -- This is for tcgen applications only, and 
c               even there, it's optional.
c     18.  200 mb u-component
c     19.  200 mb u-component
c     20.  SST
c

c       in the output for some models (like GFS and GDAS).  Note that
c       for 10m winds, with GRIB2, so far with all of the GRIB2 model
c       data we've seen to this point, they all have the same IDs for 
c       10m winds for all models, so no need to break out by model

c       and value.  Most models list the level type as 105 (which means
c       height above the ground) and then a level value of 10.  But

c        GRIB2 Read for genesis diagnostics
c
c        If we are attempting to perform genesis diagnostics, then 
c        read in data now that will allow us to do that.
c
c        The order of the variables in the reads is set up so that, 
c        ideally, we will read in the first 8 fields and not need 
c        anything else, e.g., q850, and then RH at these 
c        levels: 1000, 925, 800, 750, 700, 650, 600 mb.  However, 
c        some models, like SHiELD & T-SHiELD, do not have RH at these
c        levels, but they do have T & q, so in those cases we would 
c        have to compute RH, and therefore need to read in T & q at
c        those levels.
c
c        This is the GRIB2 reading section.

c
c        If we are attempting to perform genesis diagnostics, then 
c        read in data now that will allow us to do that.
c
c        The order of the variables in the reads is set up so that, 
c        ideally, we will read in the first 9 fields and not need 
c        anything else, e.g., SST, q850, and then RH at these 
c        levels: 1000, 925, 800, 750, 700, 650, 600 mb.  However, 
c        some models, like SHiELD & T-SHiELD, do not have RH at these
c        levels, but they do have T & q, so in those cases we would 
c        have to compute RH, and therefore need to read in T & q at
c        those levels.
c

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine reads the input NetCDF file for the 
c     tracked parameters for one lead time.
c
c     There are up to 9 fields that are read in that will be used to
c     locate the storm position.  There are an additional 4 variables
c     (500 mb u- and v-components and 10 m u- and v- components) that
c     will not be used for tracking, but only for helping to estimate
c     the next first guess position (500 mb winds) and for estimating
c     the max near-surface wind speeds in the vicinity of the storm
c     (10 m winds).
c
c     Fields read in are listed here.  Numbers indicate positioning in
c     the readflag logical array:
c
c     1.   850 mb absolute vorticity
c     2.   700 mb absolute vorticity
c     3.   850 mb u-component
c     4.   850 mb v-component
c     5.   700 mb u-component
c     6.   700 mb v-component
c     7.   850 mb geopotential height
c     8.   700 mb geopotential height
c     9.   MSLP
c     10.  10-m u-component
c     11.  10-m v-component
c     12.  500 mb u-component
c     13.  500 mb v-component
c     14.  300-500 mb mean temperature
c     15.  500 mb geopotential height
c     16.  200 mb geopotential height
c     17.  Land-Sea mask -- This is for tcgen applications only, and 
c               even there, it's optional.
c     18.  200 mb u-component
c     19.  200 mb u-component
c     20.  SST
c
c     For genesis humidity & temperature parameters (if requested), the
c     list of variables goes as follows:
c
c      1.  850 mb specific humidity
c      2. 1000 mb relative humidity
c      3.  925 mb relative humidity
c      4.  800 mb relative humidity
c      5.  750 mb relative humidity
c      6.  700 mb relative humidity
c      7.  650 mb relative humidity
c      8.  600 mb relative humidity
c      9. 1000 mb specific humidity
c     10.  925 mb specific humidity
c     11.  800 mb specific humidity
c     12.  750 mb specific humidity
c     13.  700 mb specific humidity
c     14.  650 mb specific humidity
c     15.  600 mb specific humidity
c     16. 1000 mb temperature
c     17.  925 mb temperature
c     18.  800 mb temperature
c     19.  750 mb temperature
c     20.  700 mb temperature
c     21.  650 mb temperature
c     22.  600 mb temperature
c     23.  500 mb omega
c
c     If the user has requested to check the cyclone phase space for
c     this run (phaseflag set to 'y' and phasescheme set to 'cps'), 
c     then we need to have gp height data for 900-300 mb at every 50
c     mb.  Some of those levels for gp height data were already read
c     in with the read of the initial 17 parameters, but we will be
c     sure to read in the others, if requested.

c      NetCDF read for Cyclone Phase Space diagnostics
c
c      If we are attempting to determine the cyclone structure using
c      Hart's cyclone phase space, then read in data now that will 
c      allow us to do that.  If we are instead just using the 
c      mid-level (300-500 mb) mean temperature to do that with a 
c      simple warm-core check, then that mean temperature field was
c      already read in above in the read loop for the standard 
c      variables.  The variables needed here for CPS are pretty 
c      straightforward:  gp height every 50 mb from 300 to 900 mb.
c      keep in mind that we have already read in a few of these 
c      gp height records for selected levels above.

c      anything else, e.g., SST, q850, and then RH at these

      subroutine conv1d2d_logic (imax,jmax,lb1d,lb2d,need_to_flip_lats)
c
c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine converts a 1-dimensional input 
c     array of logical data (lb1d) into a 2-dimensional output
c     array (dimension imax,jmax) of logical data (lb2d).
c
c     This subroutine was updated in 6/2000 to add the scanning mode
c     flag (iscanflag) as an input.  This is in order to handle grids
c     that are flipped.  Most grids -- NCEP, UKMET, ECMWF -- have
c     point (1,1) as the uppermost left point on the grid, and the
c     data goes from north to south.  Some grids -- GFDL and the new
c     NAVGEM grid -- are flipped; their point (1,1) is the lowermost
c     left point, and their data goes from south to north.  So if
c     the scanning mode flag indicates northward scanning data
c     (bit 2 in the flag is turned on), we catch it in this
c     subroutine and flip the data ourselves for our own arrays,
c     since this whole program is structured around the data going
c     from north to south.  As of the writing of this, only the
c     first 3 bits of the scanning flag are used, which is why we
c     can use the mod statement in the code below.
c
c     UPDATE 8/2009: I removed the scanning mode flag, since that is
c     GRIB-specific.  The north-south determination is now handled with
c     the logical flag need_to_flip_lats.
c
c     PARAMETERS:
c
c     INPUT:
c     imax     Number of gridpoints in i direction in input box
c     jmax     Number of gridpoints in j direction in input box
c     lb1d     1-d array containing logical bitmap values
c     iscanflag This is kgds(11), an integer value in the GDS,

     &                               ,xmissing_val,need_to_flip_lats)
c
c     ABSTRACT: The purpose of this routine is to create a 2-d logical
c     bitmap to be used for masking out regions with missing data, 
c     such as for a regional grid with irregular boundaries (such as 
c     we've seen for the regional / nested FV3).  This bitmap will 
c     have the same functionality as a GRIB1/GRIB2 bitmap.  The trick
c     is that NetCDF does not have a logical bitmap within its 
c     definition, so we need to make one.  We do this by reading in 
c     the "missing_value" attribute for any variable, then here we 
c     scan through all the data values retrieved from the NetCDF read,
c     and then for all grid points with missing values we set the 
c     valid_pt flag to .false.
c
c     Note the use of the need_to_flip_lats flag.  This is in order to 
c     handle grids that are flipped.  Most grids -- NCEP, UKMET, ECMWF
c     -- have point (1,1) as the uppermost left point on the grid, and
c     the data goes from north to south.  Some grids -- GFDL and the 
c     new NAVGEM grid -- are flipped; their point (1,1) is the lowermost
c     left point, and their data goes from south to north.  So if
c     the need_to_flip_lats flag was set to TRUE in getgridinfo, meaning
c     that we have northward scanning data, we catch it in this
c     subroutine and flip the data ourselves for our own arrays,
c     since this whole program is structured around the data going
c     from north to south.

     &                                 ,need_to_flip_lats)
c
c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine converts a 1-dimensional input 
c     array of real data (dat1d) into a 2-dimensional output
c     array (dimension imax,jmax) of real data (dat2d).
c
c     This subroutine was updated in 6/2000 to add the scanning mode
c     flag (iscanflag) as an input.  This is in order to handle grids
c     that are flipped.  Most grids -- NCEP, UKMET, ECMWF -- have
c     point (1,1) as the uppermost left point on the grid, and the
c     data goes from north to south.  Some grids -- GFDL and the new
c     NAVGEM grid -- are flipped; their point (1,1) is the lowermost
c     left point, and their data goes from south to north.  So if
c     the scanning mode flag indicates northward scanning data
c     (bit 2 in the flag is turned on), we catch it in this
c     subroutine and flip the data ourselves for our own arrays,
c     since this whole program is structured around the data going
c     from north to south.  As of the writing of this, only the
c     first 3 bits of the scanning flag are used, which is why we
c     can use the mod statement in the code below.
c
c     UPDATE 8/2009: I removed the scanning mode flag, since that is
c     GRIB-specific.  The north-south determination is now handled with
c     the logical flag need_to_flip_lats.
c
c     INPUT:
c     imax     Number of gridpoints in i direction in input box
c     jmax     Number of gridpoints in j direction in input box
c     dat1d    1-d real array of data
c     need_to_flip_lats  logical flag, set in getgridinfo, that
c              indicates if data is correctly N-to-S, or if it is
c              S-to-N and needs to be flipped.
c
c     OUTPUT:
c     dat2d    2-d real array of data
c
      logical(1) :: need_to_flip_lats
      real ::   dat1d(imax*jmax)
      real ::   dat2d(imax,jmax)
c
      if (need_to_flip_lats) then

        ! Input data is south to north; flip the data while
        ! converting to 2-d grid....

        do ilat=1,jmax
          ilatix = jmax - ilat + 1
          do ilon=1,imax

c
c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine reads in a modified TC Vitals file
c     for the current time and prints out those cards (storms) that
c     have been selected to be processed.  It also takes the initial 
c     positions from the tcv card for each storm and puts them into 
c     the slonfg & slatfg arrays.
c
c     The reason that these are referred to as modified tcvitals is
c     that the format is different from standard TC vitals format.
c     These vitals are created by a previous run of this tracker 
c     executable, and the storm identifier is different than that 
c     for a standard tcvitals.  The storm
c     identifier contains the date/time that the storm was first 
c     identified, and the lat/lon position at which it was first
c     identified.
c
c     EXAMPLE:  The following is a standard TC Vitals record, split
c               up over 3 lines:

c     EXAMPLE:  If the vitals record is for a non-officially numbered
c               system (i.e., any system that's not a TC being tracked
c               by NHC or JTWC), then the storm number is replaced 
c               by the characters "FOF", for "Found On the Fly" by 
c               the  tracker.

c
c       NOTE: The "F000" in there at character positions 12-15 are to 
c             indicate the forecast hour within that forecast cycle 
c             that the storm was first detected.  For a vitals record,
c             this is always going to be 000 for fhr=0h, and really,
c             it's not even needed.  However, I'm keeping it in there
c             in order to keep the storm ID format exactly the same 
c             as the  output_atcf_sink forecast track record, which 
c             does have a use for that "FXXX" identifier in the 
c             output.
c
c     INPUT:
c     lgvcard    integer unit number for tcgen-tcvitals card
c
c     OUTPUT:
c     maxstorm  max # of storms to be handled for this case
c     iret      return code from this subroutine
c
c     INPUT/OUTPUT: 
c     numtcv    As an input, this variable contains the number of 
c               *tropical* cyclone vitals (i.e., regular tcvitals) that
c               were read off of the input tcvitals file in subroutine
c               read_tcv_card.  This variable will be incremented for 
c               each "modified" vitals record that is read in this 
c               subroutine, and so as output, this variable will 
c               contain the combined total of tcvitals and modified 
c               vitals records.

c       imply "minimum Latitude".  However, for the grids that we'll be

c       under gds(4) as the northernmost point (eg., in MRF, 
c       gds(4) = 90), so for this program, use gds(4) as your max lat, 
c       and gds(7) as your min lat. However, in case NCEP, UKMET or

c       BUGFIX (August, 2001): It is possible to have an input grid

c       and min latitudes listed in the GRIB GDS will be confused, so we
c       need to check the value of the GRIB scanning mode flag here.

c     ABSTRACT: The purpose of this subroutine is to read the "time"
c     dimension and "time data" from the NetCDF file so that we know
c     how many time levels there are and what those time levels are.
c     One reason for doing this is that some models, like the GFDL
c     FV3, do not output hour 0 data, so we need to check this first
c     before running through the tracking processing for the various 
c     hours.  We will take the list of hours read in here directly from
c     the NetCDF file and compare that against the *requested* list of 
c     forecast hours that the user has entered.  The user might not be 
c     aware that there is no hour 0 data for a given model.  We compare
c     these two lists of forecast hours and then write a message if 
c     there is a lead time that is not in the NetCDF file.

c
c     OUTPUT:

c                 NetCDF file, as read in from this subroutine

c
c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine checks to see if the input lat/lon
c     point is associated with four surrounding (i,j) locations that
c     have valid data.  The writing of this routine was prompted by the
c     HFIP project in February, 2009.  Some of their high resolution
c     data for their inner nests contained grids that had been rotated
c     from native map projections to regular lat/lon grids, but that
c     rotation left "empty" spots on the lat/lon grid where there is
c     no data.  Then when searching in find_maxmin, we were running
c     barnes iterations from these lat/lon locations where there was
c     no data, which would give artificially low values at those
c     lat/lon locations (because the  barnes scheme would only include
c     points that were relatively far away where there was valid data).
c     So in this routine, we call subroutine  fix_latlon_to_ij in order
c     to get the nearest (i,j) coordinates, and then we check all of
c     these points to make sure that valid data exist.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine takes an input lat/lon position and
c     assigns it to a nearby (i,j) gridpoint.  If this is being used
c     before the call to check_closed_contour after the  barnes analysis
c     to see if we have a storm or not, then the lat/lon position that
c     is input into this subroutine is one which was obtained from a
c     barnes analysis, so it is essentially an area-weighted average
c     of nearby points.  What we need to do in this subroutine is find
c     the actual nearby gridpoint which does have the actual raw max or
c     min value.  Then we return the (i,j) coordinates of that point as
c     well as that raw data value at that point.

c     We want to do a simple search in the very few points around
c     this (ipfix,jpfix) point to find the raw max or min data
c     value.  First we need to set up a 4x4 box to search:
c     
c               o     o     o     o
c     
c     
c               o     a     b     o
c                      +

c     
c     
c               o     o     o     o
c     
c     In the above diagram, if "+" is the lat/lon location of our
c     barnes-found point (i.e., the input (parmlon,parmlat)), and
c     a-b-c-d is the square of points surrounding "+", we only want
c     to look out 1 layer of points further.  So first we need to
c     know, for each case we're looking at, if "+" got assigned to
c     a or b or c or d.  By the way, if the parmlon falls directly
c     on a gridpoint in either the i or j direction, we will only
c     look at the 2 gridpoints on either side of that point, as
c     opposed to having 4 points set up as in the box above.

c
c     ABSTRACT: This routine calculates the relative vorticity (zeta)
c     from u,v on a lat/lon grid. Centered finite 
c     differences are used on the interior points and one-sided 
c     differences are used on the boundaries.
c
c     NOTE: There are 3 critical arrays in this subroutine, the first
c     being zeta and the 2nd and 3rd being u and v.  There is a 
c     critical difference in the array indexing for the levels.  For
c     zeta, the array is dimensioned with levels from 1 to 3, with 
c     1 = 850, 2 = 700, 3 = sfc.  However, there are extra levels 
c     for the winds, such that the level dimension goes 1 = 850, 
c     2 = 700, 3 = 500, 4 = 200, 5 = sfc, and this is annotated now
c     by the use of the "nlev850", "nlev700" and "levsfc" variables
c     from module level_parms.  So we need to be sure to properly 
c     annotate that in this routine.

c     Figure out what level of data we have and what the array 
c     indices should be.

        ! z = 1 for 850 mb zeta, w = 1 for 850 mb winds
c        w = 1

      else if (z == 2) then
        ! z = 2 for 700 mb zeta, w = 2 for 700 mb winds
c        w = 2  
        w = nlev700  ! part of 1/2022 bugfix for levsfc winds
      else if (z == 3) then
        ! z = 3 for sfc zeta, w = 5 for sfc (10m) winds
c        w = 4
        w = levsfc  ! 1/2022 bugfix for levsfc winds, needed because 
                    ! 200 mb winds were added which are now in the #4
                    ! slot of the u & v arrays.  So, to future-proof
                    ! this, use the level IDs from module level_parms
                    ! instead of the hard-wired numbers.
      endif

c     Calculate grid increments for interior and edge points.

c     IMPORTANT: If dtk is defined in module trig_vals in km, then
c     we need to multiply by 1000 here to get meters.  If it's defined
c     as meters, just let it be.  Since the wind values are given in 
c     meters, that's why we need the dlon values to be in meters.

      if (dtk < 750.) then     ! chances are, dtk was defined as km
        dfix = 1000.0
      else                     ! dtk was already defined as meters
        dfix = 1.0
      endif

      dlon_edge = dtk * dfix * dlon          ! Di dist over 1 grid pt
      dlat_edge = dtk * dfix * dlat          ! Dj dist over 1 grid pt
      dlon_inter = dtk * dfix * 2.0 * dlon   ! Di dist over 2 grid pts
      dlat_inter = dtk * dfix * 2.0 * dlat   ! Dj dist over 2 grid pts


c     Calculate required trig functions.  These are functions of 
c     latitude.  Remember that the grid must go from north to south.
c     This north-to-south requirement has 
c     already been checked in subroutine  getgridinfo.  If necessary,
c     any flipping of the latitudes was done there, and flipping of
c     the data, again if necessary, was done in subroutine  getdata.

      do j=2,jmax-1
         rlat(j) = glatmax - ((j-1) * dlat)
         cosfac(j) = cos(dtr*rlat(j))
         tanfac(j) = (tan(dtr*rlat(j)))/erad
      enddo

c     Set trig factors at end points to closest interior point
c     to avoid a singularity if the domain includes the poles,
c     which it will for the global grids (MRF, GDAS, GFS, UKMET,NCE)

      cosfac(1) = cosfac(2)
      tanfac(1) = tanfac(2)
      cosfac(jmax) = cosfac(jmax-1)
      tanfac(jmax) = tanfac(jmax-1)

c     NOTE: These next bits of vorticity calculation code assume that 
c           the input grid is oriented so that point (1,1) is the upper
c           left-most (NW) and point (imax,jmax) is the lower right-
c           most point.  Any other grids will probably crash the 
c           program due to array out of bounds errors.
c     NOTE: Before each calculation is done, the logical array is 
c           checked to make sure that all the data points in this 
c           calculation have valid data (ie., that the points are not
c           outside a regional model's boundaries).
c
c !!! IMPORTANT NOTE: While testing this, I uncovered a bug, which was
c     that I had the "j+1" and "j-1" reversed.  Just from a physical 
c     understanding, the du/dy term at a point is calculated by taking 
c     the u value north of the point minus the u value south of the 
c     point. Intuitively, this is u(j+1) - u(j-1).  However, we have 
c     designed this program to have the northernmost point as
c     the beginning of the grid (i.e., for the global grids, j=1 at 90N,
c     and j increases southward).  Thus, if you would do u(j+1) -
c     u(j-1), you would actually be taking the u value south of the 
c     point minus the u value north of the point, EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE
c     OF WHAT YOU WANT.  Therefore, the vorticity calculations have
c     been changed so that we now have u(j-1) - u(j+1).
c
c     UPDATE FEB 2009:  With limited domain grids that have missing
c     data on them (such as you would have for a grid that has been
c     converted from a non-lat/lon grid to a lat/lon grid), we were
c     running into problems below with the setting of zeta values to
c     a missing value of -999.  In place of this, the easiest thing to
c     do is to simply assign a value of the background coriolis value
c     to that point.  No, this is not correct, but it is the easiest
c     workaround for this right now.  Setting it to zero would be too
c     far off.  Setting it to the coriolis component has a net effect
c     of not having much impact on the  barnes scheme result.

      subroutine divcal (imax,jmax,dlon,dlat,divx4,vp,w,idvcret)
c
c     ABSTRACT: This routine calculates the divergence 
c     from u,v on a lat/lon grid. Centered finite 
c     differences are used on the interior points and one-sided 
c     differences are used on the boundaries.
c
c     NOTE: There are 3 critical arrays in this subroutine, the first
c     being divergence and the 2nd and 3rd being u and v.  There is a 
c     critical difference in the array indexing for the levels.  For
c     divergence, the array is dimensioned with levels from 1 to 3, with
c     1 = 850, 2 = 700, 3 = sfc.  However, there are extra levels 
c     for the winds, such that the level dimension goes 1 = 850, 
c     2 = 700, 3 = 500, 4 = 200, 5 = sfc, and this is annotated now
c     by the use of the "nlev850", "nlev700" and "levsfc" variables
c     from module level_parms.  So we need to be sure to properly 
c     annotate that in this routine.
c

c     vp    Logical; bitmap array used for regional grids
c     w     integer indicates which index to use for the vertical
c           level, with 1=850, as described in the doc block above.

c     Calculate grid increments for interior and edge points.

c     IMPORTANT: If dtk is defined in module trig_vals in km, then
c     we need to multiply by 1000 here to get meters.  If it's defined
c     as meters, just let it be.  Since the wind values are given in 
c     meters, that's why we need the dlon values to be in meters.

      if (dtk < 750.) then     ! chances are, dtk was defined as km
        dfix = 1000.0
      else                     ! dtk was already defined as meters
        dfix = 1.0
      endif

      dlon_edge = dtk * dfix * dlon          ! Di dist over 1 grid pt
      dlat_edge = dtk * dfix * dlat          ! Dj dist over 1 grid pt
      dlon_inter = dtk * dfix * 2.0 * dlon   ! Di dist over 2 grid pts
      dlat_inter = dtk * dfix * 2.0 * dlat   ! Dj dist over 2 grid pts


c     Calculate required trig functions.  These are functions of 
c     latitude.  Remember that the grid must go from north to south.
c     This north-to-south requirement has 
c     already been checked in subroutine  getgridinfo.  If necessary,
c     any flipping of the latitudes was done there, and flipping of
c     the data, again if necessary, was done in subroutine  getdata.

      do j=2,jmax-1
         rlat(j) = glatmax - ((j-1) * dlat)
         cosfac(j) = cos(dtr*rlat(j))
         tanfac(j) = (tan(dtr*rlat(j)))/erad
      enddo

c     Set trig factors at end points to closest interior point
c     to avoid a singularity if the domain includes the poles,
c     which it will for the global grids (MRF, GDAS, GFS, UKMET,NCE)

      cosfac(1) = cosfac(2)
      tanfac(1) = tanfac(2)
      cosfac(jmax) = cosfac(jmax-1)
      tanfac(jmax) = tanfac(jmax-1)

c     NOTE: These next bits of divergence calculation code assume that 
c           the input grid is oriented so that point (1,1) is the upper
c           left-most (NW) and point (imax,jmax) is the lower right-
c           most point.  Any other grids will probably crash the 
c           program due to array out of bounds errors.
c     NOTE: Before each calculation is done, the logical array is 
c           checked to make sure that all the data points in this 
c           calculation have valid data (ie., that the points are not
c           outside a regional model's boundaries).
c
c !!! IMPORTANT NOTE: While testing this, I uncovered a bug, which was
c     that I had the "j+1" and "j-1" reversed.  Just from a physical 
c     understanding, the du/dy term at a point is calculated by taking 
c     the u value north of the point minus the u value south of the

c     running into problems below with the setting of div values to
c     a missing value of -999.  In place of this, the easiest thing to
c     do is to simply assign a value of zero to the divergence.
c     No, this is not correct, but it is the easiest workaround for 
c     this right now.

c     in that area.  The (i,j) locations of the maxes/mins are returned
c     in the maxmini and maxminj arrays.  The input 3-character string
c     cmaxmin will tell the subroutine to look for a "max" or a "min".
c
c     INPUT:
c     imax     Number of gridpoints in i direction in input grid
c     jmax     Number of gridpoints in j direction in input grid
c     ibeg     i-index for upper left location of grid to search
c     iend     i-index for lower right location of grid to search
c     jbeg     j-index for upper left location of grid to search
c     jend     j-index for lower right location of grid to search
c     fxy      Real array of data values
c     valid_pt Logical bitmap masking non-valid grid points.  This is a
c              concern for the regional models, which are interpolated

c     We will use the mean and standard deviation info as
c     part of our guideline for when to stop searching for maxes & mins.
c     We will set the search cut-off threshold at one standard deviation
c     above the mean for min searches.  So, for the example of mslp, if
c     the mean pressure over the whole domain is 1010 mb and the 
c     standard deviation is 12 mb, then when we are searching, if the
c     lowest available (i.e., hasn't been found in a previous iteration
c     of this loop) pressure is 1022, then it's time to stop searching.

c     closed contour.  Then we mask out those points in the contour (or,
c     if there is not a  closed contour, just the 8 points immediately
c     surrounding the low center) and we do another iteration of
c     search_loop to look for more lows.  We mask out points we have
c     found so that on subsequent iterations of search_loop, we will not
c     find the same old center again and again and again.....

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine performs a computation that looks out
c     along 8 radials to determine if there is a radial gradient of MSLP
c     that is at least as strong as that specified by the user.  For
c     example, if the user enters a MSLP contour interval of 1 mb, then
c     we will start at the candidate position, and in each of the 8 
c     radial directions, we will check the interpolated MSLP at discrete
c     distances out to 300 km.  If at any discrete radius along the way
c     outward, that 1-mb increase in MSLP is achieved, then set the flag
c     to Y for that radial and stop any further checking along that
c     radial, and move to the next radial.  Iterate through all 8 
c     radials, as long as there is continued success, meaning that if 
c     while going through this process, if one of the radials fails the
c     test, then this candidate point is discarded altogether, and then
c     move onto the next candidate point.  As part of this testing along
c     a radial, consider allowing perhaps a slight drop along a radial
c     (maybe something like 0.05 mb?) to account for noise, but if it's
c     any more than that, then fail the radial and discard the candidate
c     point.  NOTE: In the first testing of this routine in early 2023,
c     it was found that for hi-res T-SHiELD data, using a value of 
c     xmslp_noise > 0 allowed too many noise disturbances through, so 
c     I have set it to zero.

c     increment (likely every 45 degrees, but could be changed), work
c     outward starting at 5 or 10 km radius and go out to 100 km.  At
c     each point, check to see if the user-specified pressure gradient
c     has been satisfied.  Additionally, check to see if the gradient 
c     continues sloping up as you go outward, until you reach the final
c     radius.  If at any radius, you find an MSLP value that is lower
c     than the one immediately radially inward, then this gradient 
c     check will fail for the entire candidate point.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine checks for a low-level (10-m) 
c     cyclonic circulation, in a manner that is meant to emulate how
c     NHC assesses a disturbance in order to determine whether or not
c     TC formation has occurred.  We will do a check at three different
c     radii (initially 75, 125 and 175 km), and if the check passes at
c     any one of these, then the low-level wind circulation is 
c     satisfied, the flag is set to y, and the subroutine returns to
c     the calling routine.  At each candidate radius, we do a check of
c     the Vt at 16 equally-spaced azimuths.  There are 4 points in each
c     quadrant.  We average those 4 points to get a mean Vt for that
c     azimuth.  Once we have a mean Vt for all 16 azimuths, go through 
c     the azimuths, one at a time, in a clockwise fashion, and check to see
c     if their mean cyclonic Vt passes a threshold.  As long as 2 in a
c     row do not fail, the test passes (i.e., every other one can pass
c     and that is okay).

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine masks out grid points for a storm that
c     is currently being tracked.  It is called after a fix has been 
c     made at the current forecast hour.  It is only used as a backup,
c     that is, if the mslp data were not there and/or a fix position
c     for mslp could not be made, then that means that the mask would 
c     not be able to get updated using the routine in subroutine  
c     check_closed_contour.  But we still do need to update that mask,
c     so we will instead do it based on wind circulation.  We will go
c     out radially from the center, starting at 40 km, then every 
c     40 km from there on out.  When the mean cyclonic Vt drops below
c     3 m/s, stop searching, and then mask out all grid points within
c     that last-searched radius.

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine checks a field of data around an input
c     (ix,jx) data point to see if a closed contour exists around 
c     that data point.  It can check for a closed contour on a max or a 
c     min field, depending on the value of the input variable 'cmaxmin'.
c     The algorithm works by examining rings of the 8 data points 
c     surrounding a data point that is in the contour interval.  For
c     example, in the diagram below, the X represents the location of
c     the local minimum value which was passed into this routine with
c     the coordinates (ix,jx), let's say it's 985 mb.  And let's assume
c     that the data values at points A-I are all in the 4 mb contour 
c     interval of 985-989 mb, and that all the surrounding points have
c     data values >= 989.  To test for a closed contour, we first check
c     the ring of 8 points immediately around point X to see what their
c     data values are.  If a data value is found that is below the 
c     lower limit of this contour interval (985 mb) or lower than the
c     local minimum value at the X point that we initially targeted 
c     (985 mb), then we do NOT have a closed contour, and we exit this
c     subroutine.  But in our example, that's not the case, and we have
c     5 points (B,D,E,F,G) that are in the interval.  So in our next 
c     iteration of the loop, we set up 5 rings, each one set up around 
c     the points found in the first iteration (B,D,E,F,G), and we check 
c     the 8 points around each of those points.  A logical array is 
c     used so that as soon as a point is found, it is flagged as being 
c     found.  In this way, when we look at the ring around point D, for
c     example, we won't pick point X again and set up another ring 
c     around it in the next ring iteration and end up in an infinite 
c     loop, going back and forth between point X and point D.  While 
c     checking the 8 points in a ring, if a found data value is above 
c     our contour interval (i.e., >= 989 mb), we just ignore the 
c     point; we only mark points that are in our contour interval, 
c     and again, if we find a point below our contour interval, we 
c     exit the subroutine with a flag indicating a closed contour was
c     NOT found.  So in this method, we keep spreading out from the 
c     initial local minimum and creating and checking new rings until 
c     we either: (a) Hit the edge of the regional grid, in which case 
c     we consider a closed contour NOT found, (b) Run into a data 
c     point that has been marked as being under the influence of 
c     another nearby low, in which case we consider a closed contour 
c     NOT found, (c) Run into a point which is below (above) our 
c     contour interval for a min (max) check, in which case we 
c     consider a closed contour NOT found, or (d) we run out of 
c     points to keep searching, we have no rings left to create and 
c     check because all of the surrounding points are above (below) 
c     our contour interval for a min (max) check, and by default we 
c     consider this a closed contour and return to the calling 
c     subroutine a flag indicating such.

c
c     UPDATE: This subroutine was updated to keep searching for 
c     multiple closed contours until it can't find anymore.  The 
c     input parameter num_requested_contours dictates how many 
c     contours to search for.  In the case of just trying to roughly
c     locate new centers and establish that there is a closed 
c     circulation, num_requested_contours will = 1, and we will exit
c     after finding that 1 contour.  But for a check after making a
c     full center fix, we set num_requested_contours = 999 so that 
c     we can keep searching for all closed contours around the low.
c     In this 999 case, you will eventually get to a point where
c     there is no closed contour.  In that case, in the standard
c     output you will see a message telling you that you hit a point
c     that is not in the contour and that there is no closed contour,
c     but you will also notice that the ccflag = y, meaning there is
c     a closed contour (because you have found at least 1 closed 
c     contour along the way).  The reason to keep searching for more
c     closed contours is that we can then return the value of the 
c     outermost closed isobar.

c     num_requested_contours  For the simple  first_ges_center check,

c              least 1 closed contour).  For the verifying check after

c     next_ring_ct Counter for the number of points that have been 
c              tagged to be used as center points for the next 
c              iteration of multiple_ring_loop.
c     next_contour_ct Counter for the number of points that have been
c              tagged to be used as center points in the first iteration
c              through single_contour_scan_loop as we begin to scan 
c              points in the *next* contour interval.  This counter gets
c              incremented when, for example, we are searching points 
c              around a current center point and we find one that is not
c              in our current interval, but rather is in the next 
c              interval.  We want to remember this point and store the 
c              location, so we increment this counter and store the 
c              location in next_contour_i and next_contour_j arrays.
c     beyond_contour_ct Counter for the number of points that have been
c              tagged to be used as center points for some subsequent 
c              iteration of successive_contours_loop.  This is 
c              different from next_contour_ct, which is used to hold 
c              the locations of points that are definitely in the 
c              *next* contour interval.  Here, we have points that we 
c              just store in a pool of potential points to be searched
c              in future iterations.  These points can come about in 
c              cases where there is a very intense, very compact low 
c              with a tight pressure gradient, such that multiple 
c              contour intervals could be spanned in between 2 adjacent
c              gridpoints (this is especially the case if the contour
c              interval you have chosen is small).  You need to be 
c              careful with how you handle this array.  Once you find 
c              that you have searchable points in next_contour_i or 
c              next_contour_j, do not just simply empty out this 
c              beyond_contour count and its i and j arrays.  The 
c              reason being that some of these "beyond" points may end
c              up being used and searched in subsequent iterations, but
c              not if we just delete them now.

c     First, set up the contour intervals that will be used.  In
c     the original version of this code, we used preset 
c     standard intervals (984,988,992,996,1000,1004....).  But upon
c     further review, it was decided that this was too arbitrary.
c     So instead, we consider the found min (max) value to be the 
c     bottom (top) of the list of contour intervals.  In this way,
c     we can clearly specify and screen storms based on the "depth" 
c     of the pressure field as compared to the surroundings.

      i = 1
      do while (i <= maxconts)
        if (cmaxmin == 'min') then
          contvals(i) = xcentval + float(i-1)*trkrinfo%contint 
          i = i + 1
        else
          iflip = maxconts - i + 1
          contvals(iflip) = xcentval - float(i-1)*trkrinfo%contint
          i = i + 1
        endif
      enddo

c     This successive_contours loop is the master loop....

      successive_contours_loop: do while (num_found_contours <
     &     num_requested_contours)

c       Find the contour interval in which the center value resides.
c       Note that the lower bound is included for a min check, while
c       the upper bound is included for a max check.  Note also that
c       this subroutine can be used to find the last closed contour,
c       and part of that functionality shows up in the next while 
c       statement where we reference "num_found_contours" in the 
c       array indeces for the contour values.  Basically, the way we
c       do this is, for example, if our central value is 990.4 mb and 
c       our contour interval is 4 mb, then in the first run through 
c       successive_contours_loop we see if we have a closed contour in
c       the interval 990.4-994.4.  If yes, then the next time through 
c       this loop, we see if we have a closed contour in the interval 
c       994.4-998.4.  If yes, then the next loop check is for 998.4-
c       1002.4, and so on....  We stop searching if we find a value 
c       that is either below the xcentval input into this subroutine
c       or below the lower value of the current contour interval (this
c       would mean a change in the gradient and would indicate that, 
c       in the case of mslp, we are heading down towards another,
c       different low).

c     ABSTRACT: This subroutine takes an (i,j) position input and 
c     returns the four neighboring (i,j) points to the east, south, 
c     west and north.  The routine checks for wrap around the GM, so 
c     that if, for example, you are on a global 360x181 grid and you
c     are at point i=360, then i+1 = 361, so you need something to 
c     adjust that back to i = 1.  Likewise, if you are at i=1 and 
c     looking for point i-1, it will adjust it to be point 360 
c     instead of the meaningless point 0 (i=0).

c        THIS SUBROUTINE USES AN ORDER N*LOG(N) QUICK SORT TO SORT A REAL (dp)
c      ARRAY X INTO INCREASING ORDER.  THE ALGORITHM IS AS FOLLOWS.  IND IS
c      INITIALIZED TO THE ORDERED SEQUENCE OF INDICES 1,...,N, AND ALL INTERCHANGES
c      ARE APPLIED TO IND.  X IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PORTIONS BY PICKING A CENTRAL
c      ELEMENT T.  THE FIRST AND LAST ELEMENTS ARE COMPARED WITH T, AND
c      INTERCHANGES ARE APPLIED AS NECESSARY SO THAT THE THREE VALUES ARE IN
c      ASCENDING ORDER.  INTERCHANGES ARE THEN APPLIED SO THAT ALL ELEMENTS
c      GREATER THAN T ARE IN THE UPPER PORTION OF THE ARRAY AND ALL ELEMENTS
c      LESS THAN T ARE IN THE LOWER PORTION.  THE UPPER AND LOWER INDICES OF ONE
c      OF THE PORTIONS ARE SAVED IN LOCAL ARRAYS, AND THE PROCESS IS REPEATED
c      ITERATIVELY ON THE OTHER PORTION.  WHEN A PORTION IS COMPLETELY SORTED,
c      THE PROCESS BEGINS AGAIN BY RETRIEVING THE INDICES BOUNDING ANOTHER
c      UNSORTED PORTION.
c
c      INPUT PARAMETERS -   N - LENGTH OF THE ARRAY X.
